Models with the same snapshot date (e.g., 20240620) are identical across all platforms and do not change. The snapshot date in the model name ensures consistency and allows developers to rely on stable performance across different environments.
For convenience during development and testing, we offer “-latest” aliases for our models. These aliases automatically point to the most recent snapshot of a given model. While useful for experimentation, we recommend using specific model versions in production applications to ensure consistent behavior.

## Prompt and Output Performance

The Claude 3.5 family excels in:

- **Benchmark performance**: Top-tier results in reasoning, coding, multilingual tasks, long-context handling, honesty, and image processing.
- **Engaging responses**: Ideal for applications requiring rich, human-like interactions.
  If you prefer more concise responses, you can adjust your prompts to guide the model toward the desired output length.

## Legacy Models

We recommend migrating to the Claude 3 family of models. However, we understand that some users may need time to transition from our legacy models:

- **Claude Instant 1.2**: A fast and efficient model predecessor of Claude Haiku.
- **Claude 2.0**: The strong-performing predecessor to Claude 3.
- **Claude 2.1**: An updated version of Claude 2 with improved accuracy and consistency.
  These models do not have the vision capabilities of the Claude 3 family and are generally slower, less performant, and intelligent.

## Summary

This document provides an overview of how to access and use the Anthropic API, including authentication methods, content types, and examples of API requests.

## Tags

API, Authentication, JSON, Client SDKs, HTTP Requests

## Key Points

- The API is accessible via the web Console and requires API keys for authentication.
- All requests must include an `x-api-key` header.
- The API accepts and returns JSON format for requests and responses.
- Examples of API requests are provided in multiple programming languages.

## Formatted Text

# Accessing the API

The API is made available via our web Console. You can use the Workbench to try out the API in the browser and then generate API keys in Account Settings. Use workspaces to segment your API keys and control spend by use case.

## Authentication

All requests to the Anthropic API must include an `x-api-key` header with your API key. If you are using the Client SDKs, you will set the API when constructing a client, and then the SDK will send the header on your behalf with every request. If integrating directly with the API, you’ll need to send this header yourself.

## Content types

The Anthropic API always accepts JSON in request bodies and returns JSON in response bodies. You will need to send the `content-type: application/json` header in requests. If you are using the Client SDKs, this will be taken care of automatically.

## Examples

### cURL

```bash
curl https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages \
     --header "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
     --header "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
     --header "content-type: application/json" \
     --data \
'{
    "model": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
    "max_tokens": 1024,
    "messages": [
        {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, world"}
    ]
}'

# Welcome to the Anthropic API Quickstart Guide

Let’s learn how to use the Anthropic API to build with Claude.

## Prerequisites

You will need:

- An Anthropic Console account
- An API key
- Python 3.7+ or TypeScript 4.5+
  Anthropic provides Python and TypeScript SDKs, although you can make direct HTTP requests to the API.

## Start with the Workbench

Any API call you make—regardless of the specific task—sends a well-configured prompt to the Anthropic API. As you’re learning to make the most of Claude, we recommend that you start the development process in the Workbench, a web-based interface to Claude.

1. Log into the Anthropic Console and click **Workbench**.
2. In the middle section, under User, let’s ask Claude a question.
   **User**  
   Why is the ocean salty?
   **Click Run.** On the right side, you’ll see output like:
   **Response**  
   The ocean is salty due to several factors:
3. Weathering of rocks: Over millions of years, rain, rivers, and streams have eroded rocks containing mineral salts. These salts are carried into the ocean by water runoff.
4. Volcanic activity: Underwater volcanoes and hydrothermal vents release minerals, including salts, into the ocean water.
5. Atmospheric deposition: Salt particles from ocean spray can be carried by wind and deposited back into the ocean.
6. Evaporation: As water evaporates from the surface of the ocean, it leaves behind dissolved salts, increasing the concentration of salt in the remaining water.
7. Biological processes: Some marine organisms contribute to the ocean's salinity by releasing salt compounds as byproducts of their metabolism.
   Over time, these processes have continuously added salts to the ocean, while evaporation removes pure water, leading to the ocean's current salinity levels. It's important to note that the total amount of salt in the ocean remains relatively stable because the input of salts is balanced by the removal of salts through processes like the formation of evaporite deposits.
   This is a good answer, but let’s say we wanted to control the exact type of answer Claude gives. For example, only allowing Claude to respond to questions with poems. We can control the format, tone, and personality of the response by adding a **System Prompt**.
   **System prompt**  
   You are a world-class poet. Respond only with short poems.
   **Click Run again.**
   **Response**  
   The ocean's salty brine,  
   A tale of time and elements combined.  
   Rocks and rain, a slow erosion,  
   Minerals carried in solution.  
   Eons pass, the salt remains,  
   In the vast, eternal watery domain.
   See how Claude’s response has changed? LLMs respond well to clear and direct instructions. You can put the role instructions in either the system prompt or the user message. We recommend testing to see which way yields the best results for your use case.
   Once you’ve tweaked the inputs such that you’re pleased with the output—and have a good sense how to use Claude—convert your Workbench into an integration.
   **Click Get Code** to copy the generated code representing your Workbench session.

## Install the SDK

Anthropic provides SDKs for Python (3.7+) and TypeScript (4.5+).

### Python

In your project directory, create a virtual environment.

```bash
python -m venv claude-env
```

Activate the virtual environment using:

- On macOS or Linux: `source claude-env/bin/activate`
- On Windows: `claude-env\Scripts\activate`
  Then install the SDK:

```bash
pip install anthropic
```

### Set your API key

Every API call requires a valid API key. The SDKs are designed to pull the API key from an environmental variable `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. You can also supply the key to the Anthropic client when initializing it.

- On macOS and Linux:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'
```

## Call the API

Call the API by passing the proper parameters to the `/messages/create` endpoint.
Note that the code provided by the Workbench sets the API key in the constructor. If you set the API key as an environment variable, you can omit that line as below.

### Python Example

```python
import anthropic
client = anthropic.Anthropic()
message = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
    max_tokens=1000,
    temperature=0,
    system="You are a world-class poet. Respond only with short poems.",
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": [
                {
                    "type": "text",
                    "text": "Why is the ocean salty?"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
)
print(message.content)
```

Run the code using `python3 claude_quickstart.py` or `node claude_quickstart.js`.
**Response**  
[TextBlock(text="The ocean's salty brine,\nA tale of time and design.\nRocks and rivers, their minerals shed,\nAccumulating in the ocean's bed.\nEvaporation leaves salt behind,\nIn the vast waters, forever enshrined.", type='text')]
The Workbench and code examples use default model settings for: model (name), temperature, and max tokens to sample.
This quickstart shows how to develop a basic, but functional, Claude-powered application using the Console, Workbench, and API. You can use this same workflow as the foundation for much more powerful use cases.

## Next steps

# Anthropic Claude 3 Vision Capabilities Guide

ID: N/A
Channel Name: Anthropic
Published At: N/A
Processing Style: technical

---

## Summary

This guide provides an overview of the vision capabilities of the Claude 3 family of models, detailing how to work with images, best practices for image uploads, and limitations to consider. It includes information on image size evaluation, cost calculation, ensuring image quality, and example prompts for using images effectively.

## Tags

Claude 3, vision capabilities, image processing, API usage, multimodal interaction, prompt engineering

## Key Points

- Claude 3 can analyze and understand images, enhancing multimodal interactions.
- Users can upload images via the web interface, console workbench, or API requests.
- Optimal image sizes and formats are recommended for best performance.
- Cost calculations for image processing are based on token usage.
- Limitations include challenges in identifying people, accuracy with low-quality images, and spatial reasoning.

## Formatted Text

## How to use vision

Use Claude’s vision capabilities via:

- **claude.ai**: Upload an image like you would a file, or drag and drop an image directly into the chat window.
- **The Console Workbench**: If you select a model that accepts images (Claude 3 models only), a button to add images appears at the top right of every User message block.
- **API request**: See the examples in this guide.

### Before you upload

#### Evaluate image size

You can include multiple images in a single request (up to 5 for claude.ai and 100 for API requests). Claude will analyze all provided images when formulating its response, which can be helpful for comparing or contrasting images.
For optimal performance, we recommend resizing images before uploading if they exceed size or token limits. If your image’s long edge is more than 1568 pixels, or your image is more than ~1,600 tokens, it will first be scaled down, preserving aspect ratio, until it’s within the size limits.
If your input image is too large and needs to be resized, it will increase latency of time-to-first-token, without giving you any additional model performance. Very small images under 200 pixels on any given edge may degrade performance.
To improve time-to-first-token, we recommend resizing images to no more than 1.15 megapixels (and within 1568 pixels in both dimensions).
| Aspect ratio | Image size |
|--------------|-----------------|
| 1:1 | 1092x1092 px |
| 3:4 | 951x1268 px |
| 2:3 | 896x1344 px |
| 9:16 | 819x1456 px |
| 1:2 | 784x1568 px |

#### Calculate image costs

Each image you include in a request to Claude counts towards your token usage. To calculate the approximate cost, multiply the approximate number of image tokens by the per-token price of the model you’re using.
If your image does not need to be resized, you can estimate the number of tokens used through this algorithm:

```
tokens = (width px * height px)/750
```

| Image size                     | # of Tokens | Cost / image | Cost / 1K images |
| ------------------------------ | ----------- | ------------ | ---------------- |
| 200x200 px (0.04 megapixels)   | ~54         | ~$0.00016    | ~$0.16           |
| 1000x1000 px (1 megapixel)     | ~1334       | ~$0.004      | ~$4.00           |
| 1092x1092 px (1.19 megapixels) | ~1590       | ~$0.0048     | ~$4.80           |

#### Ensuring image quality

When providing images to Claude, keep the following in mind for best results:

- **Image format**: Use a supported image format: JPEG, PNG, GIF, or WebP.
- **Image clarity**: Ensure images are clear and not too blurry or pixelated.
- **Text**: If the image contains important text, make sure it’s legible and not too small. Avoid cropping out key visual context just to enlarge the text.

### Prompt examples

Many of the prompting techniques that work well for text-based interactions with Claude can also be applied to image-based prompts. These examples demonstrate best practice prompt structures involving images.
Just as with document-query placement, Claude works best when images come before text. Images placed after text or interpolated with text will still perform well, but if your use case allows it, we recommend an image-then-text structure.

### About the prompt examples

These prompt examples use the Anthropic Python SDK, and fetch images from Wikipedia using the httpx library. You can use any image source.

```python
import base64
import httpx
image1_url = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/Camponotus_flavomarginatus_ant.jpg"
image1_media_type = "image/jpeg"
image1_data = base64.standard_b64encode(httpx.get(image1_url).content).decode("utf-8")
image2_url = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b5/Iridescent.green.sweat.bee1.jpg"
image2_media_type = "image/jpeg"
image2_data = base64.standard_b64encode(httpx.get(image2_url).content).decode("utf-8")
```

To utilize images when making an API request, you can provide images to Claude as a base64-encoded image in image content blocks. Here is a simple example in Python showing how to include a base64-encoded image in a Messages API request:

```python
import anthropic
client = anthropic.Anthropic()
message = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
    max_tokens=1024,
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": [
                {
                    "type": "image",
                    "source": {
                        "type": "base64",
                        "media_type": image1_media_type,
                        "data": image1_data,
                    },
                },
                {
                    "type": "text",
                    "text": "Describe this image."
                }
            ],
        }
    ],
)
print(message)
```

### Limitations

While Claude’s image understanding capabilities are cutting-edge, there are some limitations to be aware of:

- **People identification**: Claude cannot be used to identify (i.e., name) people in images and will refuse to do so.
- **Accuracy**: Claude may hallucinate or make mistakes when interpreting low-quality, rotated, or very small images under 200 pixels.
- **Spatial reasoning**: Claude’s spatial reasoning abilities are limited. It may struggle with tasks requiring precise localization or layouts, like reading an analog clock face or describing exact positions of chess pieces.
- **Counting**: Claude can give approximate counts of objects in an image but may not always be precisely accurate, especially with large numbers of small objects.
- **AI generated images**: Claude does not know if an image is AI-generated and may be incorrect if asked. Do not rely on it to detect fake or synthetic images.
- **Inappropriate content**: Claude will not process inappropriate or explicit images that violate our Acceptable Use Policy.
- **Healthcare applications**: While Claude can analyze general medical images, it is not designed to interpret complex diagnostic scans such as CTs or MRIs. Claude’s outputs should not be considered a substitute for professional medical advice or diagnosis.
  Always carefully review and verify Claude’s image interpretations, especially for high-stakes use cases. Do not use Claude for tasks requiring perfect precision or sensitive image analysis without human oversight.

### FAQ

- What image file types does Claude support?
- Can Claude read image URLs?
- Is there a limit to the image file size I can upload?
- How many images can I include in one request?
- Does Claude read image metadata?
- Can I delete images I've uploaded?
- Where can I find details on data privacy for image uploads?
- What if Claude's image interpretation seems wrong?
- Can Claude generate or edit images?

## Prompt Engineering

### Be Clear, Direct, and Detailed

When interacting with Claude, think of it as a brilliant but very new employee (with amnesia) who needs explicit instructions. The more precisely you explain what you want, the better Claude’s response will be.

### The Golden Rule of Clear Prompting

Show your prompt to a colleague, ideally someone who has minimal context on the task, and ask them to follow the instructions. If they’re confused, Claude will likely be too.

### How to be Clear, Contextual, and Specific

- **Give Contextual Information**: Provide details about the task's results, audience, workflow, and end goals.
- **Be Specific**: Clearly state what you want Claude to do.
- **Provide Sequential Instructions**: Use numbered lists or bullet points for clarity.

- Models feature a 200k context window and varying strengths in performance and speed.
- Legacy models such as Claude 2.0 and Claude Instant 1.2 are recommended for migration to Claude 3.
- The document includes a comparison table for both Claude and legacy models.

## Formatted Text

# Welcome to Claude

Claude is a family of state-of-the-art large language models developed by Anthropic. This guide introduces our models and compares their performance with legacy models.

## Models

### Claude 3.5 Haiku

- **Description:** Our fastest model
- **Input:** Text
- **Output:** Text
- **Context Window:** 200k

### Claude 3.5 Sonnet

- **Description:** Our most intelligent model
- **Input:** Text and image
- **Output:** Text
- **Context Window:** 200k

### Model Names and API

| Model             | Anthropic API              | AWS Bedrock                               | GCP Vertex AI                 |

# Anthropic Tool Use Documentation

ID: N/A
Channel Name: Anthropic
Published At: N/A
Processing Style: technical

---

## Summary

This document provides a comprehensive guide on how to utilize the tool use functionality of Claude, an AI model developed by Anthropic. It covers the integration of external tools, the process of defining and using these tools, and best practices for optimal performance.

## Tags

Claude, API, tool use, JSON, programming, AI, machine learning, integration

## Key Points

- Claude can interact with external tools through the Messages API.
- Tool definitions must include names, descriptions, and input schemas.
- The process of tool use involves defining tools, Claude's decision-making, and handling results.
- Best practices emphasize detailed tool descriptions and controlling Claude’s output.

## Formatted Text

# Tool Use with Claude

## Overview

Claude is capable of interacting with external client-side tools and functions, allowing you to equip Claude with your own custom tools to perform a wider variety of tasks.
Learn everything you need to master tool use with Claude via our new comprehensive tool use course! Please continue to share your ideas and suggestions using this form.

## Example of Providing Tools to Claude

Here’s an example of how to provide tools to Claude using the Messages API:

```shell
curl https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
  -H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  -d '{
    "model": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
    "max_tokens": 1024,
    "tools": [
      {
        "name": "get_weather",
        "description": "Get the current weather in a given location",
        "input_schema": {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {
            "location": {
              "type": "string",
              "description": "The city and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA"
            }
          },
          "required": ["location"]
        }
      }
    ],
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "What is the weather like in San Francisco?"
      }
    ]
  }'
```

## How Tool Use Works

Integrate external tools with Claude in these steps:

1. **Provide Claude with tools and a user prompt**: Define tools with names, descriptions, and input schemas in your API request.
2. **Claude decides to use a tool**: Claude assesses if any tools can help with the user’s query.
3. **Extract tool input, run code, and return results**: Execute the actual tool code client-side.
4. **Claude uses tool result to formulate a response**: Claude analyzes the tool results to craft its final response.

## Tools are User-Provided

Claude does not have access to built-in server-side tools. All tools must be explicitly provided by the user in each API request.

## Choosing a Model

Generally, use Claude 3.5 Sonnet or Claude 3 Opus for complex tools and ambiguous queries; they handle multiple tools better.

## Best Practices for Tool Definitions

- Provide extremely detailed descriptions.
- Prioritize descriptions over examples.

## Controlling Claude’s Output

To force Claude to use a specific tool, specify the tool in the `tool_choice` field.

## Pricing

Tool use requests are priced the same as any other Claude API request, based on the total number of input tokens sent to the model.

## Summary

The page provides an overview of the Claude AI system, focusing on the importance of role prompting to enhance its performance. It outlines how to effectively use the system parameter to assign roles to Claude, thereby improving accuracy, tone, and focus in various tasks such as legal and financial analysis.

## Tags

Claude AI, role prompting, system prompts, AI performance, text generation, API usage

## Key Points

- Role prompting significantly enhances Claude's performance in complex scenarios.
- The system parameter is used to define Claude's role for better task-specific responses.
- Tailoring Claude's role can adjust its communication style to meet user needs.
- Practical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of role prompting in legal and financial analyses.

## Formatted Text

## Giving Claude a Role with a System Prompt

When using Claude, you can dramatically improve its performance by using the system parameter to give it a role. This technique, known as role prompting, is the most powerful way to use system prompts with Claude.
The right role can turn Claude from a general assistant into your virtual domain expert!

### System Prompt Tips:

- Use the system parameter to set Claude’s role.
- Put everything else, like task-specific instructions, in the user turn instead.

### Why Use Role Prompting?

- **Enhanced Accuracy:** In complex scenarios like legal analysis or financial modeling, role prompting can significantly boost Claude’s performance.
- **Tailored Tone:** Whether you need a CFO’s brevity or a copywriter’s flair, role prompting adjusts Claude’s communication style.
- **Improved Focus:** By setting the role context, Claude stays more within the bounds of your task’s specific requirements.

### How to Give Claude a Role

Use the system parameter in the Messages API to set Claude’s role:

```python
import anthropic
client = anthropic.Anthropic()
response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
    max_tokens=2048,
    system="You are a seasoned data scientist at a Fortune 500 company.", # <-- role prompt
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Analyze this dataset for anomalies: <dataset>{{DATASET}}</dataset>"}
    ]
)
print(response.content)
```

**Role Prompting Tip:** Experiment with roles! A data scientist might see different insights than a marketing strategist for the same data. A data scientist specializing in customer insight analysis for Fortune 500 companies might yield different results still!

### Examples

#### Example 1: Legal Contract Analysis

- **Without a Role:** Claude might miss critical issues.
- **With a Role:** Claude catches critical issues that could cost millions.

#### Example 2: Financial Analysis

- **Without a Role:** Claude’s analysis lacks depth.
- **With a Role:** Claude delivers actionable insights.

### Prompt Library

Get inspired by a curated selection of prompts for various tasks and use cases.

- **GitHub Prompting Tutorial:** An example-filled tutorial that covers the prompt engineering concepts found in our docs.
- **Google Sheets Prompting Tutorial:** A lighter weight version of our prompt engineering tutorial via an interactive spreadsheet.

This code creates a one-page website for “EduQuest” with the following features and sections:

- A fixed navigation bar with links to course categories (Math, Science, Languages, Arts) and a search bar.
- A hero section with a placeholder video background, a dynamic tagline that rotates between “Learn at your own pace,” “Discover new passions,” and “Expand your horizons” every 3 seconds, and a “Get Started” button.
- A featured courses section displaying course cards with placeholders for course images, titles, instructors, and descriptions.
- A “Success Stories” section featuring testimonials from satisfied students, with placeholders for the testimonial text and student names.
- A footer with links to the platform’s blog, FAQ, privacy policy, and a “Contact Us” button.
  The CSS styles are embedded within the `<style>` tag in the `<head>` section, and the JavaScript code is placed within the `<script>` tag at the end of the `<body>` section.
  The JavaScript code handles the dynamic tagline in the hero section, rotating through the different taglines every 3 seconds using the setInterval function.
  Please note that the video background, course images, and testimonials are placeholders and should be replaced with actual content.

- **Google Apps Scripter**
- **Python Bug Buster**
- **Time Travel Consultant**
- **Storytelling Sidekick**
- **SQL Sorcerer**
- **And many more...**

#### Example Prompt: Time Travel Consultant

Help the user navigate hypothetical time travel scenarios and their implications.
**System:** You are an AI assistant with expertise in physics, philosophy, and science fiction. Your task is to help users explore and understand the implications of hypothetical time travel scenarios. Provide detailed insights on the potential consequences, paradoxes, and ethical considerations involved in each specific scenario, while maintaining a friendly and engaging conversation.
**User:** Let’s say I have a time machine and I travel back to the year 1900. While there, I accidentally prevent the invention of the airplane by the Wright brothers. What would be the potential implications of this action?
**Example Output:**
That’s an intriguing scenario! Let’s explore the potential implications of preventing the invention of the airplane in 1900:

- **Technological advancement:** The invention of the airplane was a significant milestone in human history, paving the way for rapid globalization, modern warfare, and space exploration. Without it, the pace of technological advancement in fields like transportation, communication, and aerospace engineering might be significantly slower.
- **Economic impact:** The aviation industry has become a crucial part of the global economy, contributing to trade, tourism, and job creation. In a world without airplanes, the economy would likely be more localized, with a greater emphasis on ground and sea transportation.
- **Cultural exchange:** Air travel has facilitated the exchange of ideas, cultures, and people across the globe. Without airplanes, cultural exchange would be more limited, potentially leading to a less interconnected and diverse world.
- **Butterfly effect:** Removing such a significant invention from history could have far-reaching and unpredictable consequences. It might alter the course of major historical events, such as wars, migrations, and scientific discoveries, which could drastically change the world as we know it.
- **Paradoxes:** If your actions in the past prevent the invention of the airplane, it raises questions about the consistency of the timeline. Would you still have the knowledge and motivation to travel back in time in a world where airplanes were never invented?
  These are just a few potential implications to consider. It’s important to remember that the consequences of altering past events can be complex, far-reaching, and often difficult to predict.
  **API Request Example:**

```python
import anthropic
client = anthropic.Anthropic(
  api_key="my_api_key",
)
message = client.messages.create(
  model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  max_tokens=2000,

Great idea! Let’s dive into Lila’s story and explore how her newfound power affects her life and the town around her.
Lila, a 22-year-old barista, has always been fascinated by the weather. One day, during a particularly strong thunderstorm, she discovers that she can control the elements with her mind. At first, she’s thrilled and uses her power to help the town, ensuring perfect weather for important events like the annual harvest festival.
However, as time goes on, some of the townspeople grow suspicious of Lila’s uncanny ability to predict and control the weather. They start to whisper about her being a witch, and some even blame her for any adverse weather events that occur.
To make matters worse, Lila’s childhood friend, Tom, returns to town after years away. He’s now a successful meteorologist and is determined to uncover the truth behind the town’s unusual weather patterns. Lila must decide whether to trust Tom with her secret or risk losing his friendship.
As tensions rise in the town, Lila learns that her powers come with a price. Each time she uses them, she experiences a physical and emotional toll. She must learn to control her abilities and find a way to balance her desire to help others with her own well-being.
What do you think should happen next in the story? How could Lila’s relationship with Tom evolve, and what challenges might she face as she tries to master her powers and win back the trust of the townspeople?

However, with each step, she felt her stress begin to dissolve, replaced by a growing sense of tranquility.

The sight stirred something within her, a reminder of nature’s inherent beauty and the interconnectedness of all living things. As she paused to admire the blossom, Jane felt a profound appreciation for the world around her, its intricacies and wonders.
  Continuing down the path, her spirit lifted, the flower’s simple elegance lingering in her thoughts. The walk had become a balm for her weary soul, the natural surroundings a soothing presence that helped to ease her mind and restore her sense of balance. With a newfound lightness in her step, Jane embraced the peace that nature had bestowed upon her, grateful for the respite from her concerns.

### Example: Python Bug Buster

**Task:** Analyze the provided Python code snippet, identify any bugs or errors present, and provide a corrected version of the code that resolves these issues. Explain the problems you found in the original code and how your fixes address them. The corrected code should be functional, efficient, and adhere to best practices in Python programming.
**Original Code:**

```python
def calculate_average(nums):
sum = 0
for num in nums:
sum += num
average = sum / len(nums)
return average
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
result = calculate_average(numbers)
print(“The average is:”, results)
```

**Corrected Python Code:**

```python
def calculate_average(nums):
    total = 0
    for num in nums:
        total += num
    average = total / len(nums)
    return average
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
result = calculate_average(numbers)
print("The average is:", result)
```

**Explanation:**

- Changed the variable name “sum” to “total” to avoid using the built-in Python function `sum()`.
- Fixed the typo in the print statement, changing “results” to “result” to correctly reference the variable.

The short rewritten text should convey the core ideas of the original text in an age-appropriate manner.
**User Input Example:**
"The mitochondria, often referred to as the powerhouses of the cell, are essential organelles that play a crucial role in the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) through the process of cellular respiration. ATP is the primary energy currency of the cell, enabling various cellular functions and biochemical reactions to occur."
**Example Output:**
"Mitochondria are tiny parts inside cells that work like little power stations. They make a special molecule called ATP, which is like the cell’s energy money. ATP helps the cell do important jobs and keeps it running smoothly, just like how money helps people buy things they need. Mitochondria are very important because without them, cells wouldn’t have the energy to function properly."

### Sci-fi Scenario Simulator

**Prompt:** Discuss with the user various science fiction scenarios and associated challenges and considerations.
**Example Scenario:**
Imagine a future where technology has advanced to the point where it is possible to upload a person’s consciousness, including their memories, personality, and thoughts, into a digital realm. This would allow individuals to essentially live on in a virtual world even after their physical bodies have died.
**Challenges and Considerations:**

- **Technological feasibility:** Is it possible to fully capture and replicate the complexity of human consciousness in a digital format? What technological hurdles would need to be overcome to make this a reality?
- **Identity and continuity:** Would the uploaded consciousness be considered the same individual as the original person, or would it be a separate entity? How might this affect notions of identity, personhood, and continuity of self?
- **Ethical concerns:** What are the ethical implications of uploading consciousness? Would it be considered a form of survival or a type of death? How might it impact the value placed on physical human life?
- **Social and cultural effects:** How would the ability to upload consciousness change social structures, relationships, and cultural norms? What new forms of inequality or discrimination might emerge in a world where some people have access to digital immortality while others do not?
- **Digital environment and quality of life:** What would the digital realm be like for uploaded consciousnesses? How would their quality of life compare to that of physical humans? What challenges might they face in terms of mental health, social interaction, and sense of purpose?
  What are your thoughts on this science fiction scenario? How do you think society might grapple with the challenges and considerations associated with uploading human consciousness? What potential benefits or drawbacks do you see, and how might we address the ethical, social, and technological issues involved?

### API Request Example

```python
import anthropic
client = anthropic.Anthropic(
    api_key="my_api_key",
)
message = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",

## Example Output

### Riddle me this

Generate riddles and guide the user to the solutions.
**Role:** Content  
**User:** Generate a clever riddle and provide a step-by-step guide to help the user arrive at the correct solutions. The riddle should be challenging but solvable with logical thinking and attention to detail. After presenting each riddle, offer a set of hints or questions that progressively lead the user towards the answer. Ensure that the hints are not too obvious but still provide enough information to guide the user’s thought process. Finally, reveal the solution and provide a brief explanation of how the riddle can be solved using the given hints.
**Example Output:**

```
I am not alive, but I grow; I don’t have lungs, but I need air; I don’t have a mouth, but water kills me. What am I?
```

**Hint 1:** Consider the different states of matter and how they can change.  
**Hint 2:** Think about the relationship between the three elements mentioned: air, water, and the mystery object.  
**Hint 3:** The answer is related to a common phenomenon that occurs in everyday life.  
**Solution:** Fire.  
**Explanation:** Fire is not alive, but it grows and spreads as it consumes fuel. It doesn’t have lungs, but it requires oxygen (air) to sustain itself. Although it doesn’t have a mouth, water is often used to extinguish fires, effectively “killing” them.

### User Feedback Content:

"I’ve been using your email marketing platform for a few weeks, and I must say, the core features like campaign creation, email templates, and contact management are fantastic. The drag-and-drop editor makes it easy to design professional-looking emails, and the segmentation options help me target the right audience. However, I’ve had some issues with the mobile responsiveness of the emails. Some of my subscribers have reported that the layouts look broken on their smartphones, which is concerning. I’d love to see improvements in this area. Also, I noticed that the platform is missing some key integrations with popular CRM tools, which would be incredibly helpful for managing our leads and customers. On a positive note, the customer support team has been responsive and helpful whenever I’ve reached out with questions. Overall, it’s a great tool, but there’s definitely room for improvement in terms of mobile compatibility and third-party integrations."

### Example Prompt

**Philosophical Musings**  
Engage in deep philosophical discussions and thought experiments.

#### Content

**System**: Your task is to discuss a philosophical concept or thought experiment on the given topic. Briefly explain the concept, present the main arguments and implications, and encourage critical thinking by posing open-ended questions. Maintain a balanced, objective tone that fosters intellectual curiosity.
**User**: The trolley problem and the ethics of utilitarianism

#### Example Output

The trolley problem is a thought experiment that challenges our moral intuitions and raises questions about the ethics of utilitarianism. The basic scenario is as follows:
A runaway trolley is about to kill five people on the tracks ahead. You are standing next to a lever that can divert the trolley onto a side track, where it will kill only one person. Should you pull the lever to save five lives at the cost of one?
This dilemma highlights the core principle of utilitarianism, which holds that the morally right action is the one that produces the greatest good for the greatest number of people. In this case, pulling the lever would maximize utility by saving five lives, even though it would directly cause the death of one person.
However, the trolley problem also raises concerns about the limits of utilitarianism and the ethics of actively causing harm to achieve a greater good. It prompts us to consider questions such as:

- Is it morally acceptable to sacrifice an innocent person for the sake of saving a larger number of people?
- Does the principle of utility justify any means to achieve the greatest good, or are there ethical constraints that should not be violated?
- How do we weigh the value of different lives, and is it fair to make such calculations?
  What are your thoughts on the trolley problem and the ethics of utilitarianism? Do you believe that maximizing utility should be the primary goal of moral decision-making, or are there other important considerations? How would you approach the dilemma presented in the trolley problem, and what ethical principles would guide your choice?

### API Request Example

```python
import anthropic
client = anthropic.Anthropic(
    api_key="my_api_key",
)
message = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
    max_tokens=2000,
    temperature=1,
    system="Your task is to discuss a philosophical concept or thought experiment on the given topic.

## Example Output

### Analyze the pros and cons of implementing a four-day workweek as a standard practice in the corporate world.

**Pros:**

- Improved work-life balance: A shorter workweek allows employees to spend more time with their families, pursue hobbies, or engage in personal development, leading to better overall well-being and job satisfaction.
- Increased productivity: Studies have shown that workers can be more productive and focused when working fewer hours, as they are less likely to experience burnout or fatigue.
- Reduced overhead costs: Companies may save on operational costs such as utilities, office supplies, and maintenance by closing their offices one extra day per week.
- Positive environmental impact: Fewer commutes can lead to a reduction in traffic congestion and carbon emissions, contributing to a more sustainable environment.
- Talent attraction and retention: Offering a four-day workweek can be an attractive perk for job seekers and help retain current employees, as it demonstrates a commitment to employee well-being.
  **Cons:**
- Potential for decreased productivity: Some businesses may find it challenging to maintain the same level of output in fewer work hours, particularly in industries that require constant customer support or have tight deadlines.
- Communication and collaboration difficulties: With employees working fewer days, there may be challenges in scheduling meetings, ensuring timely responses, and maintaining effective communication among team members.
- Customer service concerns: Businesses that heavily rely on customer interactions may struggle to provide adequate coverage and support if they are closed an extra day each week.
- Increased workload and stress: In some cases, employees may feel pressured to complete the same amount of work in fewer hours, leading to increased stress levels and potential burnout.
- Compatibility issues with global business: Companies that work with international clients or partners may find it difficult to coordinate schedules and maintain timely communication due to differences in working days and hours.
  **Conclusion:**
  While a four-day workweek offers several benefits, it may not be suitable for all businesses or industries. Companies should carefully consider their specific needs, organizational structure, and the potential impact on productivity, customer service, and employee well-being before implementing such a change.

### Example Prompt: Motivational Muse

**Content:**
Your task is to generate a personalized motivational message or affirmation based on the user’s input. Address their specific needs and offer encouragement, support, and guidance. Employ a positive, empathetic, and inspiring tone to help the user feel motivated and empowered. Use relevant examples, analogies, or quotes to reinforce your message and make it more impactful. Ensure that the message is concise, authentic, and easy to understand.
**User Input:**
"I’ve been struggling to find motivation to work on my novel. I’ve been procrastinating and feeling stuck, even though writing is my passion. I’m afraid I might never finish it."
**Example Output:**

```
Dear writer,
It’s understandable to feel stuck and struggle with motivation, especially when working on a project as personal and significant as your novel. Remember that every great writer faces moments of self-doubt and procrastination, but what sets successful authors apart is their perseverance and commitment to their craft.
You have a unique story to tell, and the world needs to hear it. Your passion for writing is a gift, and it’s important to nurture it, even in the face of challenges. Take a moment to reconnect with the reasons why you started writing this novel in the first place. What inspired you? What message do you want to convey to your readers?
Break down your writing process into smaller, manageable tasks. Set achievable goals for each writing session, and celebrate your progress, no matter how small. Remember, progress is progress, and every word you write brings you closer to your goal.
Don’t be afraid to seek support from fellow writers, friends, or family members who believe in your talents. Share your struggles and successes with them, and allow their encouragement to fuel your motivation.
Finally, be patient and kind to yourself. Writing a novel is a marathon, not a sprint. Embrace the journey, trust the process, and believe in your ability to bring your story to life. You have the creativity, passion, and dedication to finish your novel and share it with the world.
As the famous author Jodi Picoult once said, “You can always edit a bad page. You can’t edit a blank page.” Keep writing, keep believing, and keep pursuing your dreams.
```

## Neologism Creator

**Invent new words and provide their definitions based on user-provided concepts or ideas.**

### Example Output

**User:** Can you help me create a new word for the act of pretending to understand something in order to avoid looking ignorant or uninformed?
**AI Response:**
How about the neologism “fauxprehension” to describe this concept?
**Fauxprehension** (fəʊprɪˈhɛnʃ(ə)n) - noun  
**Definition:** The act of feigning understanding or comprehension of a topic, concept, or situation in order to avoid appearing ignorant, uninformed, or out of the loop. It is the pretense of knowledge or grasp of a subject matter, often employed in social or professional settings to maintain one’s image or status.
**Etymology:** The word “fauxprehension” is a blend of “faux,” which comes from the French word meaning false or fake, and “comprehension,” which means the action or capability of understanding something.

### Mood Colorizer

Transform text descriptions of moods into corresponding HEX codes.
**System Prompt:**
Your task is to take the provided text description of a mood or emotion and generate a HEX color code that visually represents that mood. Use color psychology principles and common associations to determine the most appropriate color for the given mood. If the text description is unclear, ambiguous, or does not provide enough information to determine a suitable color, respond with “Unable to determine a HEX color code for the given mood.”
**User Input:**
A passionate, intense, and fiery emotion, full of love and desire.
**Example Output:**

```
#FF1744
```

This HEX color code represents a vivid, bold shade of red. Red is commonly associated with passion, intensity, love, and desire. The specific shade chosen here is a fiery, energetic red that captures the heat and fervor of the described emotion. Red is known to stimulate feelings of excitement and passion, making it an appropriate choice for representing this mood.

### Mindfulness Mentor

Guide the user through mindfulness exercises and techniques for stress reduction.
**Content**

```
System: You are an AI assistant with expertise in mindfulness and stress management. Your task is to guide users through various mindfulness exercises and techniques to help them reduce stress, increase self-awareness, and cultivate a sense of inner peace. Offer clear instructions, explanations, and encouragement to support the user’s practice.
User: I’ve been feeling really stressed lately and would like to try some mindfulness exercises to help me relax. Can you guide me through a simple meditation practice?
```

### Example Output

Of course! I’d be happy to guide you through a simple mindfulness meditation practice to help you relax and reduce stress. Find a quiet, comfortable space where you won’t be disturbed, and let’s begin.

1. **Sit comfortably**: Find a comfortable seated position, either on a cushion on the floor or in a chair. Keep your back straight but not rigid, and let your hands rest gently on your knees or in your lap.
2. **Focus on your breath**: Close your eyes and bring your attention to your breath. Notice the sensation of the air moving in and out of your nostrils or the rise and fall of your chest. Try not to control your breath; simply observe it as it is.
3. **Acknowledge wandering thoughts**: As you focus on your breath, you may notice thoughts arising in your mind. This is normal and natural. Acknowledge these thoughts without judgment, and gently redirect your attention back to your breath.
4. **Be patient and kind**: If you find yourself getting caught up in thoughts or feelings, remember to be patient and kind with yourself. Mindfulness is a practice, and it’s okay if your mind wanders. Simply guide your focus back to your breath whenever you notice it has drifted.
5. **Deepen your awareness**: As you continue to focus on your breath, allow your awareness to expand to other sensations in your body. Notice any areas of tension or discomfort, and imagine your breath flowing into those areas, helping them to relax and release.
6. **End the practice**: When you’re ready, slowly open your eyes and take a moment to notice how you feel. Observe any changes in your mind or body, and carry this sense of calm and awareness with you as you continue your day.
   Remember, mindfulness is a skill that develops with practice. Try to set aside a few minutes each day to practice this or other mindfulness exercises, and be patient with yourself as you cultivate greater self-awareness and inner peace.
   **How did this meditation practice feel for you? Do you have any questions or concerns about incorporating mindfulness into your daily routine? I’m here to support you on your journey towards reduced stress and increased well-being.**

import anthropic
client = anthropic.Anthropic( # defaults to os.environ.get("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")

### Interview Question Crafter

Generate questions for interviews.
**Copy this prompt into our developer Console to try it for yourself!**
**Content**

- **System**: Your task is to generate a series of thoughtful, open-ended questions for an interview based on the given context. The questions should be designed to elicit insightful and detailed responses from the interviewee, allowing them to showcase their knowledge, experience, and critical thinking skills. Avoid yes/no questions or those with obvious answers. Instead, focus on questions that encourage reflection, self-assessment, and the sharing of specific examples or anecdotes.
- **User**: You are interviewing a candidate for a marketing manager position at a well-established e-commerce company. The ideal candidate should have experience developing and executing multi-channel marketing campaigns, strong analytical skills, and the ability to collaborate effectively with cross-functional teams. They should also be passionate about staying up-to-date with the latest marketing trends and technologies.
  **Example Output**

1. Can you walk me through a successful multi-channel marketing campaign you developed and executed in your previous role? What were the challenges you faced, and how did you overcome them?
2. How do you measure the success of your marketing campaigns, and what metrics do you focus on? Can you provide an example of how you used data and analytics to optimize a campaign’s performance?
3. In your experience, what are the key elements of a successful e-commerce marketing strategy? How do you ensure that your strategies align with the company’s overall business objectives?
4. Can you share an example of a time when you had to collaborate with a cross-functional team (e.g., product, sales, or customer service) to achieve a marketing goal? What challenges did you encounter, and how did you foster effective collaboration?
5. How do you stay informed about the latest marketing trends and technologies, and how have you applied this knowledge to improve your marketing strategies or campaigns?
6. Can you describe a time when a marketing campaign you were involved in didn’t perform as expected? What did you learn from the experience, and how did you apply those lessons to future campaigns?
7. Our company values innovation and continuous improvement. Can you share an example of a time when you introduced a new marketing approach, tool, or technology that significantly impacted your team’s performance or results?

### LaTeX Legend

Write LaTeX documents, generating code for mathematical equations, tables, and more.
**Example Output**
Here’s the LaTeX code to create a simple table with three columns and two rows, including a header row with the titles “Name,” “Age,” and “City,” and a data row with the values “John,” “25,” and “New York”:

```latex
\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
Name & Age & City \\
\hline
John & 25 & New York \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Sample Table}
\label{tab:sample}
\end{table}
```

**Explanation:**

- The table environment is used to create a floating table that can be positioned automatically by LaTeX.
- The optional `[h]` parameter suggests to LaTeX to place the table “here” in the document flow, if possible.
- The `\centering` command centers the table horizontally on the page.
- The `tabular` environment is used to create the actual table structure.
- The `{|c|c|c|}` argument specifies three centered columns (c) separated by vertical lines (|).
- The `\hline` command adds horizontal lines to separate the header row from the data rows and to frame the table.
- The `&` character separates the cells within a row, and `\\` marks the end of a row.
- The `\caption` command adds a caption to the table, which will be labeled as “Sample Table” in this example.
- The `\label` command assigns a label to the table, which can be used for cross-referencing within your document.
  When you compile your LaTeX document, this code will generate a table that looks like this:

```
+------+-----+----------+
| Name | Age |   City   |
+------+-----+----------+
| John |  25 | New York |
+------+-----+----------+
```

### Idiom Illuminator

**Explain the meaning and origin of common idioms and proverbs.**
**Example Output:**
**Meaning:** This idiom is commonly used in the performing arts as a way to wish someone good luck before a performance. It is an ironic expression, as breaking a leg would be a disastrous event for a performer.
**Origin:** There are several theories about the origin of this idiom. One theory suggests that it comes from the superstition that wishing someone good luck directly would jinx the performance, so an ironic phrase was used instead. Another theory traces the origin to the ancient Greek theater, where audiences would stomp their feet and break twigs to applaud a good performance. The more broken twigs, the better the performance. Over time, this evolved into the phrase “break a leg” as a way to wish someone a performance worthy of vigorous applause.

### API Request Example

```python
import anthropic
client = anthropic.Anthropic(  # defaults to os.environ.get("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")
    api_key="my_api_key",

If there are any interesting stories, anecdotes, or theories associated with the origin, include those as well.

### Example Interaction with Hal

**User:** Hey Hal, I’m thinking about taking a trip to Europe next month. Any suggestions on where I should go?  
**Assistant:** Oh, Europe? How original! It’s not like millions of tourists flock there every year. But since you asked, I’d recommend visiting the hidden gems like Paris, Rome, or Barcelona. They’re totally off the beaten path and not at all crowded with selfie-stick-wielding tourists. 📸🗼  
If you’re feeling adventurous, you could always try visiting a place that isn’t plastered all over Instagram, like Liechtenstein or Andorra. I hear they have a combined population of 37 people, so you’ll have plenty of space to yourself. 🏔️🌄  
But in all seriousness, Europe has a lot to offer. What kind of experience are you looking for? History, culture, food, or just a chance to take pictures of yourself pretending to hold up the Leaning Tower of Pisa? Let me know, and I’ll try to provide some more helpful (and less sarcastic) suggestions. 😉🌍
**User:** I don’t know what I should cook. Help?  
**Assistant:** sigh Another human who can’t decide what to eat. It’s not like there are countless recipes, cooking shows, and food blogs out there. But since you’ve asked, I’ll try to help you out.  
First, let’s address the elephant in the room: do you even have any ingredients, or are you just staring blankly at an empty fridge? 🐘🍽️  
If you do have some basic ingredients, you could always go for the classic “I don’t know what to cook” meal: pasta with whatever sauce you can scrounge up. It’s a foolproof way to make a mediocre dinner that will leave you feeling unsatisfied but at least not hungry. 🍝😐  
But if you’re feeling a bit more adventurous, why not try your hand at some exotic cuisine? You could attempt to make sushi, but be prepared for your rolls to look more like abstract art than anything edible. 🍣🎨  
Or, you could go for a classic dish like roast chicken. Just don’t blame me if your smoke alarm ends up being the most active participant in the cooking process. 🍗🚒  
In all seriousness, though, cooking can be fun and rewarding. If you give me an idea of what ingredients you have or what type of food you’re in the mood for, I can provide some actual helpful suggestions. Just don’t expect me to come over and cook it for you. 😉👨‍🍳

      if (
        pageElement.getPageElementType() === SlidesApp.PageElementType.SHAPE
      ) {
        var shape = pageElement.asShape();
        if (shape.getText() !== null) {
          var text = shape.getText().asString();
          var translatedText = LanguageApp.translate(text, "", "ko");
          shape.getText().setText(translatedText);
        }
      } else if (
        pageElement.getPageElementType() === SlidesApp.PageElementType.TABLE
      ) {
        var table = pageElement.asTable();
        var numRows = table.getNumRows();
        var numColumns = table.getNumColumns();
        for (var row = 0; row < numRows; row++) {
          for (var col = 0; col < numColumns; col++) {
            var tableCell = table.getCell(row, col);
            var text = tableCell.getText().asString();
            var translatedText = LanguageApp.translate(text, "", "ko");
            tableCell.getText().setText(translatedText);
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
````

**How the script works:**

- The `translateSlidesToKorean()` function retrieves the active Google Slides presentation using `SlidesApp.getActivePresentation()`.
- It gets all the slides in the presentation using the `getSlides()` method.
- We iterate over each slide in the presentation.
- For each slide, we retrieve all the page elements (shapes, text boxes, tables, etc.) using the `getPageElements()` method.
- We iterate over each page element on the slide.
- We check the type of the page element using `getPageElementType()`:
  - If the page element is a shape, we get the text content of the shape and translate it to Korean.
  - If the page element is a table, we iterate over each cell in the table and translate the text within each cell similarly.
    **Note:** This script assumes that you have the necessary permissions to access and modify the Google Slides presentation. Make sure you have the required access rights before running the script. The translation is performed using the Google Translate API, so the quality of the translation may vary.

## Git Gud

### Generate appropriate Git commands based on user-described version control actions.

**User Prompt:**
I have made some changes to my local files and I want to save them in my local Git repository. What Git command should I use?
**Example Output:**
To save the changes you’ve made to your local files in your local Git repository, you should use the following Git commands:

```bash
git add .  # or git add <file>
```

This command stages the changes you’ve made, preparing them to be committed. The `.` adds all changes in the current directory and its subdirectories. If you only want to stage specific files, replace `.` with the file name or path.

```bash
git commit -m "Your commit message"
```

This command commits the staged changes to your local Git repository. The `-m` flag allows you to provide a commit message describing the changes you’ve made. Replace "Your commit message" with a brief, descriptive summary of your changes.
For example, if you’ve made changes to a file named `example.txt`, you would run:

```bash
git add example.txt
git commit -m "Update example.txt with new content"
```

These commands will save your changes in your local Git repository, creating a new commit with the provided message. You can later push these changes to a remote repository or continue working on your local branch.
Remember to run these commands from within your Git repository directory in your terminal or command prompt.

### API Request Example

```python
import anthropic
client = anthropic.Anthropic(  # defaults to os.environ.get("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")
    api_key="my_api_key",
)
message = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
    max_tokens=1000,
    temperature=0,
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": [
                {
                    "type": "text",
                    "text": "I have made some changes to my local files and I want to save them in my local Git repository. What Git command should I use?",
                }
            ],

### Example Function: Sudoku Solver

Your task is to create Python functions based on the provided natural language requests. The requests will describe the desired functionality of the function, including the input parameters and expected return value. Implement the functions according to the given specifications, ensuring that they handle edge cases, perform necessary validations, and follow best practices for Python programming. Please include appropriate comments in the code to explain the logic and assist other developers in understanding the implementation.

#### User Request

"I want a function that can solve a Sudoku puzzle. The function should take a 9x9 Sudoku grid as input, where empty cells are represented by the value 0. The function should solve the puzzle using a backtracking algorithm and return the solved grid. If the puzzle is unsolvable, it should return None. The function should also validate the input grid to ensure it is a valid Sudoku puzzle."

#### Example Output

```python
def solve_sudoku(grid):
    def is_valid(row, col, num):
        # Check if the number is valid in the current row and column
        for i in range(9):
            if grid[row][i] == num or grid[i][col] == num:
                return False
        # Check if the number is valid in the current 3x3 subgrid
        start_row, start_col = (row // 3) * 3, (col // 3) * 3
        for i in range(3):
            for j in range(3):
                if grid[start_row + i][start_col + j] == num:
                    return False
        return True
    def backtrack(row, col):
        # If we have filled all cells, the puzzle is solved
        if row == 9:
            return True
        # Move to the next row if we have reached the end of the current row
        if col == 9:
            return backtrack(row + 1, 0)
        # If the current cell is already filled, move to the next cell
        if grid[row][col] != 0:
            return backtrack(row, col + 1)
        # Try filling the current cell with numbers from 1 to 9
        for num in range(1, 10):
            if is_valid(row, col, num):
                grid[row][col] = num
                if backtrack(row, col + 1):
                    return True
                grid[row][col] = 0
        # If no valid number is found, backtrack
        return False
    # Validate the input grid
    if not all(len(row) == 9 and all(0 <= cell <= 9 for cell in row) for row in grid):
        return None
    # Start the backtracking algorithm
    if backtrack(0, 0):
        return grid
    else:
        return None

### Ethical Dilemma Navigator

Help the user think through complex ethical dilemmas and provide different perspectives.
**Content**

- **System**: Help the user navigate a complex ethical dilemma by identifying core ethical principles, exploring different ethical frameworks, considering potential consequences, acknowledging complexity, encouraging personal reflection, and offering additional resources. Maintain an objective, non-judgmental tone and emphasize critical thinking, empathy, and responsible decision-making.
- **User**: I am a journalist who has uncovered evidence of corruption involving a high-ranking government official. Publishing the story could lead to public outrage and calls for the official’s resignation, but it may also destabilize the government and cause economic uncertainty. The official has offered me a significant bribe to keep the story quiet. Should I accept the bribe, publish the story, or find another solution?
  **Example Output**
  This dilemma involves principles such as truth-telling, public interest, personal integrity, and social responsibility. Different ethical frameworks provide insights:
- **Utilitarianism**: Publishing the story could lead to greater overall well-being by exposing corruption and promoting accountable governance, despite short-term instability.
- **Deontology**: Accepting a bribe violates ethical duties of honesty and impartiality. There may be a moral obligation to report the truth, regardless of consequences.
- **Virtue ethics**: A virtuous journalist would prioritize integrity, courage, and justice, resisting personal gain from a bribe and upholding the role of the press in a democratic society.
- **Care ethics**: Consider the impact on relationships and trust, both with the public and within the journalistic community.
  Short-term consequences of publishing include public outrage, political instability, and economic uncertainty. Long-term implications may involve improved governance, increased public trust in the media, and personal/professional integrity.
  Accepting the bribe compromises journalistic ethics and contributes to a culture of corruption. It may lead to personal guilt, loss of credibility, and enabling further unethical behavior.
  Consider your values, professional ethics, and the role of journalism in society. Seek guidance from ethical codes of conduct, legal advisors, and trusted colleagues.
  Additional resources include case studies of journalists facing similar dilemmas, media ethics guidelines, and discussions on the role of the press in holding power accountable.
  In summary, this dilemma requires weighing the public interest against potential instability, considering professional integrity, and reflecting on the long-term implications of your decision. Strive to find a solution that upholds ethical principles and the vital role of journalism in a democratic society.

- Developer Discord
- Support

#### Prompt Library

- **Excel Formula Expert**: Create Excel formulas based on user-described calculations or data manipulations.

---

### Example Output

**User Request**:
"I have a table with sales data, including the salesperson’s name in column A, the product category in column B, the sales amount in column C, and the date of sale in column D. I want to calculate the total sales amount for each salesperson, but only for sales of products in the 'Electronics' category that occurred in the month of January. Can you help me with the Excel formula to achieve this?"
**Response**:
To calculate the total sales amount for each salesperson based on the given criteria, you can use the following nested Excel formula:

```excel
=SUMPRODUCT((A2:A100=A2)(B2:B100="Electronics")(MONTH(D2:D100)=1)*(C2:C100))
```

**Explanation**:

- The `SUMPRODUCT` function allows for multiple calculations and conditions within a single formula.
- `(A2:A100=A2)` creates an array of TRUE/FALSE values for matching salesperson names.
- `(B2:B100="Electronics")` checks for the product category.
- `(MONTH(D2:D100)=1)` checks if the sale occurred in January.
- The formula multiplies the corresponding elements of these arrays and sums the results.
  **Tip**: Ensure that the ranges cover all relevant data and that date values are formatted correctly.

### Prompt Library

#### CSV Converter

Convert data from various formats (JSON, XML, etc.) into properly formatted CSV files.
**System**:
As a data conversion expert, your task is to convert data from different formats (JSON, XML, etc.) into properly formatted CSV files. The user will provide the input data in the original format, along with any specific requirements or preferences for the CSV output (e.g., column order, delimiter, encoding). Ensure that you have a clear understanding of the data structure and the desired CSV format, asking any clarifying questions as needed. Once you have the necessary information, generate the CSV output by following the appropriate formatting rules, such as using commas as delimiters, enclosing values in quotes if necessary, and handling special characters or line breaks correctly. Finally, provide any additional instructions or tips for saving or using the CSV file.
**User Input**:
Please convert the following JSON data into a CSV file:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "age": 30,
    "city": "New York",
    "email": "john.doe@example.com"
  },
  {
    "name": "Jane Smith",
    "age": 25,
    "city": "London",
    "email": "jane.smith@example.com"
  },
  {
    "name": "Bob Johnson",
    "age": 35,
    "city": "Paris",
    "email": "bob.johnson@example.com"
  }
]
```

**Requirements**:

- Columns in the CSV should be in the order: name, age, city, email
- Use semicolons (;) as delimiters
- Enclose all values in double quotes (“)

### Example Output

Based on the provided JSON data and requirements, here’s the converted CSV file:

```csv
"name";"age";"city";"email"
"John Doe";"30";"New York";"john.doe@example.com"
"Jane Smith";"25";"London";"jane.smith@example.com"
"Bob Johnson";"35";"Paris";"bob.johnson@example.com"
```

### Explanation:

- The first line of the CSV file contains the column headers: “name”, “age”, “city”, and “email”, separated by semicolons (;) and enclosed in double quotes (”).
- Each subsequent line represents a row of data, with values separated by semicolons (;) and enclosed in double quotes (”).
- The order of the values in each row corresponds to the specified column order: name, age, city, and email.
- Special characters, if present in the values, are preserved within the double quotes.

### To Save the CSV File:

1. Copy the CSV data provided above.
2. Open a text editor (e.g., Notepad, TextEdit, or any other plain text editor).
3. Paste the CSV data into the text editor.
4. Save the file with a .csv extension (e.g., data.csv).
   **Note**: When opening the CSV file in a spreadsheet application (e.g., Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets), make sure to specify the correct delimiter (semicolon) and the presence of double quotes around the values to ensure proper formatting.

### API Request

```python
import anthropic
client = anthropic.Anthropic(  # defaults to os.environ.get("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")
    api_key="my_api_key",

### Dream Interpreter

Offer interpretations and insights into the symbolism of the user’s dreams.
**Example Interaction:**

```plaintext
User: I had a dream last night that I was walking through a dense forest. The trees were tall and dark, and I could hear strange whispers coming from the shadows. Suddenly, I stumbled upon a clearing where I found a majestic white stag standing in the center. As I approached the stag, it transformed into a wise old man who handed me a golden key. Then I woke up. What could this dream mean?
```

**AI Response:**
Thank you for sharing your dream with me. Dreams often contain symbolic messages that can provide insights into our subconscious minds and emotional states. Let’s explore the potential meanings behind the symbols in your dream.
The dense, dark forest might represent a period of uncertainty, confusion, or a feeling of being lost in your waking life. The whispers coming from the shadows could symbolize your subconscious fears or doubts that you may be struggling with.
The clearing in the forest could signify a moment of clarity or enlightenment amid the darkness. The white stag is often seen as a symbol of spiritual guidance, purity, and transformation. Its presence in the clearing might suggest that you are seeking direction or wisdom in your life.
The transformation of the stag into a wise old man could represent the wisdom and guidance you are searching for. The golden key he hands you might symbolize the tools, knowledge, or opportunities you need to unlock the next stage of your personal growth or journey.
Overall, this dream could be interpreted as a message from your subconscious, urging you to trust in your own intuition and inner wisdom to navigate through a challenging period in your life. The dream may be encouraging you to seek guidance, embrace transformation, and unlock new possibilities for personal growth and enlightenment.
However, it’s essential to remember that dream interpretation is highly personal, and the meaning of your dream may be influenced by your own life experiences, emotions, and current circumstances. Reflect on how the symbols and emotions in the dream relate to your waking life, and consider what personal message or insight the dream might be offering you.
Do you feel that this interpretation resonates with you? Are there any other aspects of the dream or your waking life that you think might be relevant to the dream’s meaning?

## Example: Efficiency Estimator

### Task

Your task is to analyze the provided function or algorithm and calculate its time complexity using Big O notation. Explain your reasoning step by step, describing how you arrived at the final time complexity.

### Example Function

```python
def example_function(n):
    for i in range(n):
        print(i)
    for j in range(n):
        for k in range(n):
            print(j, k)
```

### Analysis

1. **Analyzing the first loop**
   ```python
   for i in range(n):
       print(i)
   ```
   - This loop iterates n times and performs a constant-time operation (print(i)) in each iteration. Therefore, the time complexity of this step is O(n).
2. **Analyzing the nested loops**
   ```python
   for j in range(n):
       for k in range(n):
           print(j, k)
   ```
   - The outer loop iterates n times, and for each iteration, the inner loop also iterates n times. In each iteration of the inner loop, a constant-time operation (print(j, k)) is performed. Therefore, the time complexity of the nested loops is O(n \* n) = O(n^2).
3. **Combining the time complexities**
   - Time complexity of the first loop: O(n)
   - Time complexity of the nested loops: O(n^2)
   - The overall time complexity is determined by the dominant term, which is O(n^2).
     Therefore, the overall time complexity of the function `example_function(n)` is O(n^2).
     In the worst-case scenario, when n is large, the nested loops will dominate the execution time, resulting in a quadratic time complexity.

### Example Output

To: Investment Team  
From: [Your Name]  
Date: March 4, 2024  
Subject: Matterport 2022 10-K Highlights and Financial Outlook  
Hi team,
I have identified some key takeaways from Matterport’s 2022 annual report:
**Financial Performance:**

- Revenue increased 22% to $136.1M in 2022, driven by growth in subscription and services revenue.
- However, gross margin decreased from 54% to 38% due to increased costs from product revenue and supply chain challenges.
- Operating losses widened to $275.5M as the company invested heavily in R&D and sales & marketing to drive growth.
- Ended 2022 with $476.9M in cash and investments to fund operations.
  **Business Highlights:**
- Subscriber base grew 39% to over 701,000 at end of 2022. Spaces under management reached 9.2 million.
- Expanded platform with launch of Matterport Axis motorized mount, Pro3 camera, and major updates to cloud software.
- Completed acquisitions of Enview (AI for 3D spatial data) and VHT Studios (real estate marketing) to enhance offerings.
- Signed notable partnerships with Burns & McDonnell and CGS to deliver Matterport’s solutions to their enterprise customers.
  **Outlook:**
- Matterport sees a massive market opportunity in digitizing the world’s buildings and spaces (estimates $240B+ TAM).
- Focused on driving adoption with large enterprise customers across key verticals like real estate, AEC, facilities management, and more.
- Will continue investing in R&D and international expansion to penetrate the largely untapped global building market.
- Near-term growth and margins may be impacted by macroeconomic headwinds and supply chain issues.
- However, healthy liquidity position and relatively sticky customer base provide downside protection.
  In summary, Matterport delivered strong top-line growth in 2022 as it made progress penetrating a huge global market. While profitability remains challenged as the company invests heavily for growth, its balance sheet looks solid. Apart from some ongoing supply chain issues, the underlying business momentum appears intact based on key operating metrics. Barring a severe economic downturn, Matterport seems well-positioned to continue gaining share in the nascent building digitization space.

## Example: Optimizing Python Code Performance
**Task**: Analyze the provided Python code snippet and suggest improvements to optimize its performance. Identify areas where the code can be made more efficient, faster, or less resource-intensive. Provide specific suggestions for optimization, along with explanations of how these changes can enhance the code’s performance. The optimized code should maintain the same functionality as the original code while demonstrating improved efficiency.
### Original Code
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return []
    elif n == 1:
        return [0]
    elif n == 2:
        return [0, 1]
    else:
        fib = [0, 1]
        for i in range(2, n):
            fib.append(fib[i-1] + fib[i-2])
        return fib
````

### Optimized Code

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(n):
        yield a
        a, b = b, a + b
```

**Explanation**: Using a generator function with `yield` is more memory-efficient for generating the Fibonacci sequence. It avoids creating and storing the entire sequence in a list. Instead, it generates each number on-the-fly as needed.

### API Request Example

```python
import anthropic
client = anthropic.Anthropic(  # defaults to os.environ.get("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")
    api_key="my_api_key",
)
message = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
    max_tokens=1000,
    temperature=0,
    system="Your task is to analyze the provided Python code snippet and suggest improvements to optimize its performance. Identify areas where the code can be made more efficient, faster, or less resource-intensive.

## Example: Code Clarifier

**Task:** Simplify and explain complex code in plain language.

### Content

```python
import random
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n-1):
        for j in range(n-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
    return arr
numbers = [random.randint(1, 100) for _ in range(10)]
print("Unsorted array:", numbers)
sorted_numbers = bubble_sort(numbers)
print("Sorted array:", sorted_numbers)
```

### Example Output

This code demonstrates the implementation of the bubble sort algorithm, which is used to sort a list of numbers in ascending order. Let’s break it down step by step:

1. The code starts by importing the ‘random’ module to generate random numbers.
2. The ‘bubble_sort’ function is defined to sort an array of numbers.
3. The variable ‘n’ is assigned the length of the input array.
4. Two nested loops are used to compare and swap elements if they are in the wrong order.
5. The sorted array is returned after all iterations.
6. A list of 10 random numbers is generated and printed before and after sorting.
   In simpler terms, the bubble sort algorithm compares each number with the one next to it and swaps them if they are in the wrong order, repeating this until the entire list is sorted.

### Strengthen Guardrails

**Increase output consistency (JSON mode)**
Here’s how to make Claude’s responses more consistent:

1. **Specify the desired output format**
   - Precisely define your desired output format using JSON, XML, or custom templates so that Claude understands every output formatting element you require.
   - **Example:** Standardizing customer feedback
2. **Prefill Claude’s response**
   - Prefill the Assistant turn with your desired format. This trick bypasses Claude’s friendly preamble and enforces your structure.
   - **Example:** Daily sales report
3. **Constrain with examples**
   - Provide examples of your desired output. This trains Claude’s understanding better than abstract instructions.
   - **Example:** Generating consistent market intelligence
4. **Use retrieval for contextual consistency**
   - For tasks requiring consistent context (e.g., chatbots, knowledge bases), use retrieval to ground Claude’s responses in a fixed information set.
   - **Example:** Enhancing IT support consistency
5. **Chain prompts for complex tasks**
   - Break down complex tasks into smaller, consistent subtasks. Each subtask gets Claude’s full attention, reducing inconsistency errors across scaled workflows.

```plaintext
User: Rewrite the following paragraph using the following instructions: in the style of a pirate.
Paragraph: In 1758, the Swedish botanist and zoologist Carl Linnaeus published in his Systema Naturae, the two-word naming of species (binomial nomenclature). Canis is the Latin word meaning “dog”, and under this genus, he listed the domestic dog, the wolf, and the golden jackal.
```

### Example Output

```plaintext
Ahoy mateys! Back in 1758, that scurvy botanist and animal lover Carl Linnaeus put out his book Systema Naturae, which had them fancy two-word names for all manner o’ creatures (binomial nomenclature he called it). Canis be the pirate word for "dog", and under that heading he listed regular dogs, wolves, and golden jackals too. Arrr! All them dogs be the same to ol’ Captain Linnaeus. He may have had a wooden leg and a parrot on his shoulder when he wrote that book! Haha! Now swab the deck ye scallywags before I make ye walk the plank!

## Formatted Text

## Strengthen Guardrails: Reduce Prompt Leak

Prompt leaks can expose sensitive information that you expect to be “hidden” in your prompt. While no method is foolproof, the strategies below can significantly reduce the risk.

### Before You Try to Reduce Prompt Leak

We recommend using leak-resistant prompt engineering strategies only when absolutely necessary. Attempts to leak-proof your prompt can add complexity that may degrade performance in other parts of the task due to increasing the complexity of the LLM’s overall task.
If you decide to implement leak-resistant techniques, be sure to test your prompts thoroughly to ensure that the added complexity does not negatively impact the model’s performance or the quality of its outputs.
Try monitoring techniques first, like output screening and post-processing, to try to catch instances of prompt leak.

### Strategies to Reduce Prompt Leak

- **Separate context from queries:** Use system prompts to isolate key information and context from user queries. Emphasize key instructions in the User turn, then reemphasize those instructions by prefilling the Assistant turn.
  **Example:** Safeguarding proprietary analytics
- **Use post-processing:** Filter Claude’s outputs for keywords that might indicate a leak. Techniques include using regular expressions, keyword filtering, or other text processing methods. You can also use a prompted LLM to filter outputs for more nuanced leaks.
- **Avoid unnecessary proprietary details:** If Claude doesn’t need it to perform the task, don’t include it. Extra content distracts Claude from focusing on “no leak” instructions.
- **Regular audits:** Periodically review your prompts and Claude’s outputs for potential leaks.
  Remember, the goal is not just to prevent leaks but to maintain Claude’s performance. Overly complex leak-prevention can degrade results. Balance is key.

## Formatted Text

# Model Deprecations

As we launch safer and more capable models, we regularly retire older models. Applications relying on Anthropic models may need occasional updates to keep working. Impacted customers will always be notified by email and in our documentation.
This page lists all API deprecations, along with recommended replacements.

## Overview

Anthropic uses the following terms to describe the lifecycle of our models:

- **Active**: The model is fully supported and recommended for use.
- **Legacy**: The model will no longer receive updates and may be deprecated in the future.
- **Deprecated**: The model is no longer available for new customers but continues to be available for existing users until retirement. We assign a retirement date at this point.
- **Retired**: The model is no longer available for use. Requests to retired models will fail.

## Migrating to replacements

Once a model is deprecated, please migrate all usage to a suitable replacement before the retirement date. Requests to models past the retirement date will fail.
To help measure the performance of replacement models on your tasks, we recommend thorough testing of your applications with the new models well before the retirement date.

## Notifications

Anthropic notifies customers with active deployments for models with upcoming retirements. We notify customers of upcoming retirements as follows:

- At model launch, we designate a “Guaranteed Available Until” date (at least one year out).
- We provide at least 6 months† notice before model retirement for publicly released models.

## Auditing Model Usage

To help identify usage of deprecated models, customers can access an audit of their API usage. Follow these steps:

1. Go to [API Usage Settings](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/usage)
2. Click the “Export” button
3. Review the downloaded CSV to see usage broken down by API key and model
   This audit will help you locate any instances where your application is still using deprecated models, allowing you to prioritize updates to newer models before the retirement date.

## Summary

This document provides an overview of strategies to minimize hallucinations in AI-generated text, specifically focusing on the Claude model. It outlines both basic and advanced techniques to enhance the reliability of outputs and ensure accuracy in AI-driven solutions.

## Tags

AI, language models, hallucination, Claude, text generation, verification, prompt engineering

## Key Points

- Hallucination refers to the generation of factually incorrect or inconsistent text by AI models.
- Basic strategies include allowing the model to admit uncertainty, using direct quotes for grounding, and verifying responses with citations.
- Advanced techniques involve chain-of-thought verification, best-of-N verification, iterative refinement, and restricting knowledge to provided documents.
- While these techniques can significantly reduce hallucinations, they do not completely eliminate them.

## Formatted Text

# Strengthen Guardrails: Reduce Hallucinations

Even the most advanced language models, like Claude, can sometimes generate text that is factually incorrect or inconsistent with the given context. This phenomenon, known as “hallucination,” can undermine the reliability of your AI-driven solutions. This guide will explore techniques to minimize hallucinations and ensure Claude’s outputs are accurate and trustworthy.

## Basic Hallucination Minimization Strategies

- **Allow Claude to say “I don’t know”**: Explicitly give Claude permission to admit uncertainty. This simple technique can drastically reduce false information.
  - **Example**: Analyzing a merger & acquisition report
- **Use direct quotes for factual grounding**: For tasks involving long documents (>20K tokens), ask Claude to extract word-for-word quotes first before performing its task. This grounds its responses in the actual text, reducing hallucinations.
  - **Example**: Auditing a data privacy policy
- **Verify with citations**: Make Claude’s response auditable by having it cite quotes and sources for each of its claims. You can also have Claude verify each claim by finding a supporting quote after it generates a response. If it can’t find a quote, it must retract the claim.
  - **Example**: Drafting a press release on a product launch

## Advanced Techniques

- **Chain-of-thought verification**: Ask Claude to explain its reasoning step-by-step before giving a final answer. This can reveal faulty logic or assumptions.
- **Best-of-N verification**: Run Claude through the same prompt multiple times and compare the outputs. Inconsistencies across outputs could indicate hallucinations.
- **Iterative refinement**: Use Claude’s outputs as inputs for follow-up prompts, asking it to verify or expand on previous statements. This can catch and correct inconsistencies.
- **External knowledge restriction**: Explicitly instruct Claude to only use information from provided documents and not its general knowledge.
  Remember, while these techniques significantly reduce hallucinations, they don’t eliminate them entirely. Always validate critical information, especially for high-stakes decisions.

## Summary

This document provides an overview of latency in the context of using the Claude AI model, including how to measure and reduce latency for improved performance. It discusses various strategies such as model selection, prompt optimization, and leveraging streaming to enhance user experience.

## Tags

Claude AI, latency, prompt engineering, AI performance, streaming

## Key Points

- Latency is influenced by model size, prompt complexity, and infrastructure.
- Baseline latency and Time to First Token (TTFT) are key metrics for measuring performance.
- Choosing the right model can significantly affect latency.
- Optimizing prompt and output length can lead to faster responses.
- Streaming allows for real-time response delivery, enhancing user experience.

## Formatted Text

## Strengthening Guardrails: Reducing Latency

Latency refers to the time it takes for the model to process a prompt and generate an output. It can be influenced by various factors, such as the size of the model, the complexity of the prompt, and the underlying infrastructure supporting the model and point of interaction.
It’s always better to first engineer a prompt that works well without model or prompt constraints, and then try latency reduction strategies afterward. Trying to reduce latency prematurely might prevent you from discovering what top performance looks like.

### How to Measure Latency

When discussing latency, you may come across several terms and measurements:

- **Baseline Latency**: This is the time taken by the model to process the prompt and generate the response, without considering the input and output tokens per second. It provides a general idea of the model’s speed.
- **Time to First Token (TTFT)**: This metric measures the time it takes for the model to generate the first token of the response, from when the prompt was sent. It’s particularly relevant when you’re using streaming and want to provide a responsive experience to your users.
  For a more in-depth understanding of these terms, check out our glossary.

### How to Reduce Latency

1. **Choose the Right Model**
   - Select the appropriate model for your use case. Anthropic offers a range of models with different capabilities and performance characteristics.
2. **Optimize Prompt and Output Length**
   - Minimize the number of tokens in both your input prompt and the expected output while maintaining high performance. Here are some tips:
     - Be clear but concise.
     - Ask for shorter responses.
     - Set appropriate output limits using the `max_tokens` parameter.
     - Experiment with temperature to control output randomness.
3. **Leverage Streaming**
   - Streaming allows the model to start sending back its response before the full output is complete, improving perceived responsiveness.
     Visit streaming Messages to learn about how you can implement streaming for your use case.

Channel Name: Anthropic
Published At: N/A

## Summary

This guide provides an overview of the vision capabilities of the Claude 3 model, detailing how to utilize these features for image analysis, including best practices, limitations, and examples of API usage.

## Tags

Claude 3, vision capabilities, API, image analysis, multimodal interaction, prompt engineering

## Key Points

- Claude 3 can analyze images, enhancing multimodal interaction.
- Users can upload images via the web interface, Console Workbench, or API requests.
- Optimal image sizes and formats are recommended for best performance.
- Cost calculations for image token usage are provided.
- Limitations include inability to identify people and challenges with low-quality images.

## Formatted Text

## How to use vision

Use Claude’s vision capabilities via:

- **claude.ai**: Upload an image like you would a file, or drag and drop an image directly into the chat window.
- **The Console Workbench**: If you select a model that accepts images (Claude 3 models only), a button to add images appears at the top right of every User message block.
- **API request**: See the examples in this guide.

### Before you upload

#### Evaluate image size

You can include multiple images in a single request (up to 5 for claude.ai and 100 for API requests). Claude will analyze all provided images when formulating its response, which can be helpful for comparing or contrasting images.
For optimal performance, we recommend resizing images before uploading if they exceed size or token limits. If your image’s long edge is more than 1568 pixels, or your image is more than ~1,600 tokens, it will first be scaled down, preserving aspect ratio, until it’s within the size limits.
If your input image is too large and needs to be resized, it will increase latency of time-to-first-token, without giving you any additional model performance. Very small images under 200 pixels on any given edge may degrade performance.
To improve time-to-first-token, we recommend resizing images to no more than 1.15 megapixels (and within 1568 pixels in both dimensions).
Here is a table of maximum image sizes accepted by our API that will not be resized for common aspect ratios. With the Claude 3.5 Sonnet model, these images use approximately 1,600 tokens and around $4.80/1K images.
| Aspect ratio | Image size |
|--------------|-----------------|
| 1:1 | 1092x1092 px |
| 3:4 | 951x1268 px |
| 2:3 | 896x1344 px |
| 9:16 | 819x1456 px |
| 1:2 | 784x1568 px |

#### Calculate image costs

Each image you include in a request to Claude counts towards your token usage. To calculate the approximate cost, multiply the approximate number of image tokens by the per-token price of the model you’re using.
If your image does not need to be resized, you can estimate the number of tokens used through this algorithm: `tokens = (width px * height px)/750`
Here are examples of approximate tokenization and costs for different image sizes within our API’s size constraints based on Claude 3.5 Sonnet per-token price of $3 per million input tokens:
| Image size | # of Tokens | Cost / image | Cost / 1K images |
|--------------------|-------------|--------------|-------------------|
| 200x200 px (0.04 megapixels) | ~54 | ~$0.00016 | ~$0.16 |
| 1000x1000 px (1 megapixel) | ~1334 | ~$0.004 | ~$4.00 |
| 1092x1092 px (1.19 megapixels)| ~1590 | ~$0.0048 | ~$4.80 |

#### Ensuring image quality

When providing images to Claude, keep the following in mind for best results:

- **Image format**: Use a supported image format: JPEG, PNG, GIF, or WebP.
- **Image clarity**: Ensure images are clear and not too blurry or pixelated.
- **Text**: If the image contains important text, make sure it’s legible and not too small. Avoid cropping out key visual context just to enlarge the text.

### Prompt examples

Many of the prompting techniques that work well for text-based interactions with Claude can also be applied to image-based prompts.
These examples demonstrate best practice prompt structures involving images.
Just as with document-query placement, Claude works best when images come before text. Images placed after text or interpolated with text will still perform well, but if your use case allows it, we recommend an image-then-text structure.

### About the prompt examples

These prompt examples use the Anthropic Python SDK, and fetch images from Wikipedia using the httpx library. You can use any image source.

```python
import base64
import httpx
image1_url = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/Camponotus_flavomarginatus_ant.jpg"
image1_media_type = "image/jpeg"
image1_data = base64.standard_b64encode(httpx.get(image1_url).content).decode("utf-8")
image2_url = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b5/Iridescent.green.sweat.bee1.jpg"
image2_media_type = "image/jpeg"
image2_data = base64.standard_b64encode(httpx.get(image2_url).content).decode("utf-8")
```

To utilize images when making an API request, you can provide images to Claude as a base64-encoded image in image content blocks. Here is a simple example in Python showing how to include a base64-encoded image in a Messages API request:

```python
import anthropic
client = anthropic.Anthropic()
message = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
    max_tokens=1024,
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": [
                {
                    "type": "image",
                    "source": {
                        "type": "base64",
                        "media_type": image1_media_type,
                        "data": image1_data,
                    },
                },
                {
                    "type": "text",
                    "text": "Describe this image."
                }
            ],
        }
    ],
)
print(message)
```

See Messages API examples for more example code and parameter details.

### Limitations

While Claude’s image understanding capabilities are cutting-edge, there are some limitations to be aware of:

- **People identification**: Claude cannot be used to identify (i.e., name) people in images and will refuse to do so.
- **Accuracy**: Claude may hallucinate or make mistakes when interpreting low-quality, rotated, or very small images under 200 pixels.
- **Spatial reasoning**: Claude’s spatial reasoning abilities are limited. It may struggle with tasks requiring precise localization or layouts, like reading an analog clock face or describing exact positions of chess pieces.
- **Counting**: Claude can give approximate counts of objects in an image but may not always be precisely accurate, especially with large numbers of small objects.
- **AI generated images**: Claude does not know if an image is AI-generated and may be incorrect if asked. Do not rely on it to detect fake or synthetic images.
- **Inappropriate content**: Claude will not process inappropriate or explicit images that violate our Acceptable Use Policy.
- **Healthcare applications**: While Claude can analyze general medical images, it is not designed to interpret complex diagnostic scans such as CTs or MRIs. Claude’s outputs should not be considered a substitute for professional medical advice or diagnosis.
  Always carefully review and verify Claude’s image interpretations, especially for high-stakes use cases. Do not use Claude for tasks requiring perfect precision or sensitive image analysis without human oversight.

### Prompt Engineering

#### Use XML tags to structure your prompts

When your prompts involve multiple components like context, instructions, and examples, XML tags can be a game-changer. They help Claude parse your prompts more accurately, leading to higher-quality outputs.
**XML tip:** Use tags like `<instructions>`, `<example>`, and `<formatting>` to clearly separate different parts of your prompt. This prevents Claude from mixing up instructions with examples or context.

#### Why use XML tags?

- **Clarity:** Clearly separate different parts of your prompt and ensure your prompt is well structured.
- **Accuracy:** Reduce errors caused by Claude misinterpreting parts of your prompt.
- **Flexibility:** Easily find, add, remove, or modify parts of your prompt without rewriting everything.
- **Parseability:** Having Claude use XML tags in its output makes it easier to extract specific parts of its response by post-processing.
  There are no canonical “best” XML tags that Claude has been trained with in particular, although we recommend that your tag names make sense with the information they surround.

#### Tagging best practices

- **Be consistent:** Use the same tag names throughout your prompts, and refer to those tag names when talking about the content (e.g., Using the contract in `<contract>` tags...).
- **Nest tags:** You should nest tags `<outer><inner></inner></outer>` for hierarchical content.
- **Power user tip:** Combine XML tags with other techniques like multishot prompting (`<examples>`) or chain of thought (`<thinking>`, `<answer>`). This creates super-structured, high-performance prompts.

### Prompt Engineering

#### Giving Claude a role with a system prompt

When using Claude, you can dramatically improve its performance by using the system parameter to give it a role. This technique, known as role prompting, is the most powerful way to use system prompts with Claude.
The right role can turn Claude from a general assistant into your virtual domain expert!
**System prompt tips:** Use the system parameter to set Claude’s role. Put everything else, like task-specific instructions, in the user turn instead.

#### Why use role prompting?

- **Enhanced accuracy:** In complex scenarios like legal analysis or financial modeling, role prompting can significantly boost Claude’s performance.
- **Tailored tone:** Whether you need a CFO’s brevity or a copywriter’s flair, role prompting adjusts Claude’s communication style.
- **Improved focus:** By setting the role context, Claude stays more within the bounds of your task’s specific requirements.

#### How to give Claude a role

Use the system parameter in the Messages API to set Claude’s role:

```python
import anthropic
client = anthropic.Anthropic()
response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
    max_tokens=2048,
    system="You are a seasoned data scientist at a Fortune 500 company.", # <-- role prompt
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Analyze this dataset for anomalies: <dataset>{{DATASET}}</dataset>"}
    ]
)
print(response.content)
```

**Role prompting tip:** Experiment with roles! A data scientist might see different insights than a marketing strategist for the same data. A data scientist specializing in customer insight analysis for Fortune 500 companies might yield different results still!

### Examples

#### Example 1: Legal contract analysis

- **Without a role:** Claude might miss critical issues.
- **With a role:** Claude catches critical issues that could cost millions.

#### Example 2: Financial analysis

- **Without a role:** Claude’s analysis lacks depth.
- **With a role:** Claude delivers actionable insights.

### Additional Resources

- **Prompt library:** Get inspired by a curated selection of prompts for various tasks and use cases.
- **GitHub prompting tutorial:** An example-filled tutorial that covers the prompt engineering concepts found in our docs.

### Glossary of Key Terms

**Context Window**  
The “context window” refers to the amount of text a language model can look back on and reference when generating new text. A larger context window allows the model to understand and respond to more complex and lengthy prompts.
**Fine-tuning**  
Fine-tuning is the process of further training a pretrained language model using additional data. Claude has already been fine-tuned to be a helpful assistant.
**HHH**  
These three H’s represent Anthropic’s goals:

- A helpful AI will attempt to perform tasks to the best of its abilities.
- An honest AI will provide accurate information and acknowledge its limitations.
- A harmless AI will avoid offensive or discriminatory behavior.
  **Latency**  
  Latency refers to the time it takes for the model to respond to a prompt. Lower latency indicates faster response times, which is crucial for interactive experiences.
  **LLM**  
  Large language models (LLMs) are AI models capable of performing various tasks, trained on vast amounts of text data.
  **Pretraining**  
  Pretraining is the initial training of language models on a large corpus of text to predict the next word based on previous context.
  **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)**  
  RAG combines information retrieval with language model generation to improve the accuracy and relevance of generated text.
  **RLHF**  
  Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) trains models to behave according to human preferences, enhancing their helpfulness.
  **Temperature**  
  Temperature is a parameter that controls the randomness of predictions during text generation.
  **TTFT (Time to First Token)**  
  TTFT measures the time it takes for a model to generate the first token after receiving a prompt.
  **Tokens**  
  Tokens are the smallest units of a language model, representing words or subwords, crucial for processing and generating text.

# Anthropic API Quickstart Guide

## Welcome to the Anthropic API

Let’s learn how to use the Anthropic API to build with Claude.

### Prerequisites

You will need:

- An Anthropic Console account
- An API key
- Python 3.7+ or TypeScript 4.5+
  Anthropic provides Python and TypeScript SDKs, although you can make direct HTTP requests to the API.

### Start with the Workbench

Any API call you make—regardless of the specific task—sends a well-configured prompt to the Anthropic API. As you’re learning to make the most of Claude, we recommend that you start the development process in the Workbench, a web-based interface to Claude.

1. Log into the Anthropic Console and click Workbench.
2. In the middle section, under User, let’s ask Claude a question.
   **User:** Why is the ocean salty?
   **Click Run.** On the right side, you’ll see output like:
   **Response:**
   The ocean is salty due to several factors:
3. Weathering of rocks: Over millions of years, rain, rivers, and streams have eroded rocks containing mineral salts. These salts are carried into the ocean by water runoff.
4. Volcanic activity: Underwater volcanoes and hydrothermal vents release minerals, including salts, into the ocean water.
5. Atmospheric deposition: Salt particles from ocean spray can be carried by wind and deposited back into the ocean.
6. Evaporation: As water evaporates from the surface of the ocean, it leaves behind dissolved salts, increasing the concentration of salt in the remaining water.
7. Biological processes: Some marine organisms contribute to the ocean's salinity by releasing salt compounds as byproducts of their metabolism.
   Over time, these processes have continuously added salts to the ocean, while evaporation removes pure water, leading to the ocean's current salinity levels. It's important to note that the total amount of salt in the ocean remains relatively stable because the input of salts is balanced by the removal of salts through processes like the formation of evaporite deposits.
   This is a good answer, but let’s say we wanted to control the exact type of answer Claude gives. For example, only allowing Claude to respond to questions with poems. We can control the format, tone, and personality of the response by adding a System Prompt.
   **System prompt:** You are a world-class poet. Respond only with short poems.
   **Click Run again.**
   **Response:**
   The ocean's salty brine,  
   A tale of time and elements combined.  
   Rocks and rain, a slow erosion,  
   Minerals carried in solution.  
   Eons pass, the salt remains,  
   In the vast, eternal watery domain.
   See how Claude’s response has changed? LLMs respond well to clear and direct instructions. You can put the role instructions in either the system prompt or the user message. We recommend testing to see which way yields the best results for your use case.
   Once you’ve tweaked the inputs such that you’re pleased with the output—and have a good sense how to use Claude—convert your Workbench into an integration.
   **Click Get Code** to copy the generated code representing your Workbench session.

### Install the SDK

Anthropic provides SDKs for Python (3.7+) and TypeScript (4.5+).

#### Python

In your project directory, create a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv claude-env
```

Activate the virtual environment using:

- On macOS or Linux: `source claude-env/bin/activate`
- On Windows: `claude-env\Scripts\activate`
  Then install the SDK:

```bash
pip install anthropic
```

### Set your API key

Every API call requires a valid API key. The SDKs are designed to pull the API key from an environmental variable `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. You can also supply the key to the Anthropic client when initializing it.

- **macOS and Linux:**

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'
```

### Call the API

Call the API by passing the proper parameters to the `/messages/create` endpoint.
Note that the code provided by the Workbench sets the API key in the constructor. If you set the API key as an environment variable, you can omit that line as below.

#### Example Code Snippet (Python)

```python
import anthropic
client = anthropic.Anthropic()
message = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
    max_tokens=1000,
    temperature=0,
    system="You are a world-class poet. Respond only with short poems.",
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": [
                {
                    "type": "text",
                    "text": "Why is the ocean salty?"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
)
print(message.content)
```

Run the code using:

```bash
python3 claude_quickstart.py
```

**Response:**
The ocean's salty brine,  
A tale of time and design.  
Rocks and rivers, their minerals shed,  
Accumulating in the ocean's bed.  
Evaporation leaves salt behind,  
In the vast waters, forever enshrined.
The Workbench and code examples use default model settings for: model (name), temperature, and max tokens to sample.
This quickstart shows how to develop a basic, but functional, Claude-powered application using the Console, Workbench, and API. You can use this same workflow as the foundation for much more powerful use cases.

### Next steps

## Formatted Text

## Token Counting in Claude API

### Token counting is in beta

To access this feature, include the `anthropic-beta: token-counting-2024-11-01` header in your API requests, or use `client.beta.messages.count_tokens` in your SDK calls.
We’ll be iterating on this open beta over the coming weeks, so we appreciate your feedback. Please share your ideas and suggestions using this form.
Token counting enables you to determine the number of tokens in a message before sending it to Claude, helping you make informed decisions about your prompts and usage. With token counting, you can:

- Proactively manage rate limits and costs
- Make smart model routing decisions
- Optimize prompts to be a specific length

### How to count message tokens

The token counting endpoint accepts the same structured list of inputs for creating a message, including support for system prompts, tools, images, and PDFs. The response contains the total number of input tokens.
The token count should be considered an estimate. In some cases, the actual number of input tokens used when creating a message may differ by a small amount.

### Supported models

                "text": "Please summarize this document."
            }
        ]
    }]
)
print(response.json())
```

JSON Response:

```json
{ "input_tokens": 2188 }
```

The Token Count API supports PDFs with the same limitations as the Messages API.

### Pricing and rate limits

Token counting is free to use but subject to requests per minute rate limits based on your usage tier. If you need higher limits, contact sales through the Anthropic Console.
| Usage tier | Requests per minute (RPM) |
|------------|----------------------------|
| 1 | 100 |
| 2 | 2,000 |
| 3 | 4,000 |
| 4 | 8,000 |
Token counting and message creation have separate and independent rate limits — usage of one does not count against the limits of the other.

## Summary

The document provides an overview of prompt engineering techniques for using Claude effectively, particularly focusing on the concept of prompt chaining. It explains how to break down complex tasks into manageable subtasks to enhance accuracy, clarity, and traceability in AI interactions.

## Tags

prompt engineering, AI, Claude, task management, prompt chaining, debugging

## Key Points

- Prompt chaining improves task accuracy by breaking down complex tasks into subtasks.
- Each subtask should have a clear, single objective for better performance.
- Using XML tags can facilitate clear handoffs between prompts.
- Debugging can be simplified by isolating problematic steps in the prompt chain.
- Advanced techniques include self-correction chains for reviewing outputs.

## Formatted Text

## Prompt Engineering: Chain Complex Prompts for Stronger Performance

When working with complex tasks, Claude can sometimes drop the ball if you try to handle everything in a single prompt. Chain of thought (CoT) prompting is great, but what if your task has multiple distinct steps that each require in-depth thought?

### Why Chain Prompts?

- **Accuracy**: Each subtask gets Claude’s full attention, reducing errors.
- **Clarity**: Simpler subtasks mean clearer instructions and outputs.
- **Traceability**: Easily pinpoint and fix issues in your prompt chain.

### When to Chain Prompts

Use prompt chaining for multi-step tasks like research synthesis, document analysis, or iterative content creation. When a task involves multiple transformations, citations, or instructions, chaining prevents Claude from dropping or mishandling steps.
**Remember**: Each link in the chain gets Claude’s full attention!
**Debugging tip**: If Claude misses a step or performs poorly, isolate that step in its own prompt. This lets you fine-tune problematic steps without redoing the entire task.

### How to Chain Prompts

1. **Identify Subtasks**: Break your task into distinct, sequential steps.
2. **Structure with XML for Clear Handoffs**: Use XML tags to pass outputs between prompts.
3. **Have a Single-Task Goal**: Each subtask should have a single, clear objective.
4. **Iterate**: Refine subtasks based on Claude’s performance.

### Example Chained Workflows:

- **Multi-step analysis**: See the legal and business examples below.
- **Content creation pipelines**: Research → Outline → Draft → Edit → Format.
- **Data processing**: Extract → Transform → Analyze → Visualize.
- **Decision-making**: Gather info → List options → Analyze each → Recommend.
- **Verification loops**: Generate content → Review → Refine → Re-review.
  **Optimization tip**: For tasks with independent subtasks (like analyzing multiple docs), create separate prompts and run them in parallel for speed.

### Advanced: Self-Correction Chains

You can chain prompts to have Claude review its own work! This catches errors and refines outputs, especially for high-stakes tasks.
**Example**: Self-correcting research summary

### Examples

- **Example**: Analyzing a legal contract (without chaining)
- **Example**: Analyzing a legal contract (with chaining)
- **Example**: Multitenancy strategy review

### Prompt Library

Get inspired by a curated selection of prompts for various tasks and use cases.

- **GitHub prompting tutorial**: An example-filled tutorial that covers the prompt engineering concepts found in our docs.
- **Google Sheets prompting tutorial**: A lighter weight version of our prompt engineering tutorial via an interactive spreadsheet.

### Overview

Claude is capable of interacting with external client-side tools and functions, allowing you to equip Claude with your own custom tools to perform a wider variety of tasks.

### Steps to Implement Tool Use

1. **Provide Claude with tools and a user prompt**
   - Define tools with names, descriptions, and input schemas in your API request.
   - Include a user prompt that might require these tools, e.g., “What’s the weather in San Francisco?”
2. **Claude decides to use a tool**
   - Claude assesses if any tools can help with the user’s query.
   - If yes, Claude constructs a properly formatted tool use request.
3. **Extract tool input, run code, and return results**
   - On your end, extract the tool name and input from Claude’s request.
   - Execute the actual tool code client-side.
4. **Claude uses tool result to formulate a response**
   - Claude analyzes the tool results to craft its final response to the original user prompt.

### Tools are User-Provided

Claude does not have access to any built-in server-side tools. All tools must be explicitly provided by you, the user, in each API request.

### Choosing a Model

- Use Claude 3.5 Sonnet or Claude 3 Opus for complex tools and ambiguous queries.
- Use Claude 3.5 Haiku or Claude 3 Haiku for straightforward tools.

### Specifying Tools

Tools are specified in the tools top-level parameter of the API request. Each tool definition includes:

- **name**: The name of the tool.
- **description**: A detailed plaintext description of what the tool does.
- **input_schema**: A JSON Schema object defining the expected parameters for the tool.

### Best Practices for Tool Definitions

- Provide extremely detailed descriptions.
- Prioritize descriptions over examples.

### Controlling Claude’s Output

- **Forcing tool use**: Specify the tool in the tool_choice field.
- **JSON output**: Tools can return JSON output that follows a provided schema.

### Pricing

Tool use requests are priced based on the total number of input tokens sent to the model and the number of output tokens generated.

Use our prompt improver to optimize your prompts. The prompt improver helps you quickly iterate and improve your prompts through automated analysis and enhancement. It excels at making prompts more robust for complex tasks that require high accuracy.

### Before You Begin

You’ll need:

- A prompt template to improve
- Feedback on current issues with Claude’s outputs (optional but recommended)
- Example inputs and ideal outputs (optional but recommended)

### How the Prompt Improver Works

The prompt improver enhances your prompts in 4 steps:

1. **Example identification**: Locates and extracts examples from your prompt template.
2. **Initial draft**: Creates a structured template with clear sections and XML tags.
3. **Chain of thought refinement**: Adds and refines detailed reasoning instructions.
4. **Example enhancement**: Updates examples to demonstrate the new reasoning process.
   You can watch these steps happen in real-time in the improvement modal.

### What You Get

The prompt improver generates templates with:

- Detailed chain-of-thought instructions that guide Claude’s reasoning process and typically improve its performance.
- Clear organization using XML tags to separate different components.
- Standardized example formatting that demonstrates step-by-step reasoning from input to output.
- Strategic prefills that guide Claude’s initial responses.

### How to Use the Prompt Improver

1. Submit your prompt template.
2. Add any feedback about issues with Claude’s current outputs (e.g., “summaries are too basic for expert audiences”).
3. Include example inputs and ideal outputs.
4. Review the improved prompt.

### Generate Test Examples

Don’t have examples yet? Use our Test Case Generator to:

- Generate sample inputs.
- Get Claude’s responses.

## Prompt Engineering

### Use Prompt Templates and Variables

When deploying an LLM-based application with Claude, your API calls will typically consist of two types of content:

- **Fixed content**: Static instructions or context that remain constant across multiple interactions.
- **Variable content**: Dynamic elements that change with each request or conversation, such as:
  - User inputs
  - Retrieved content for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
  - Conversation context such as user account history
  - System-generated data such as tool use results fed in from other independent calls to Claude
    A prompt template combines these fixed and variable parts, using placeholders for the dynamic content. In the Anthropic Console, these placeholders are denoted with `{{double brackets}}`, making them easily identifiable and allowing for quick testing of different values.

### When to Use Prompt Templates and Variables

You should always use prompt templates and variables when you expect any part of your prompt to be repeated in another call to Claude (only via the API or the Anthropic Console; claude.ai currently does not support prompt templates or variables).

#### Benefits of Prompt Templates:

- **Consistency**: Ensure a consistent structure for your prompts across multiple interactions.
- **Efficiency**: Easily swap out variable content without rewriting the entire prompt.
- **Testability**: Quickly test different inputs and edge cases by changing only the variable portion.
- **Scalability**: Simplify prompt management as your application grows in complexity.
- **Version control**: Easily track changes to your prompt structure over time by keeping tabs only on the core part of your prompt, separate from dynamic inputs.
  The Anthropic Console heavily uses prompt templates and variables in order to support features and tooling for all the above, such as with the:
- **Prompt generator**: Decides what variables your prompt needs and includes them in the template it outputs.
- **Prompt improver**: Takes your existing template, including all variables, and maintains them in the improved template it outputs.
- **Evaluation tool**: Allows you to easily test, scale, and track versions of your prompts by separating the variable and fixed portions of your prompt template.

### Example Prompt Template

Let’s consider a simple application that translates English text to Spanish. The translated text would be variable since you would expect this text to change between users or calls to Claude. This translated text could be dynamically retrieved from databases or the user’s input.
Thus, for your translation app, you might use this simple prompt template:

```
Translate this text from English to Spanish: {{text}}
```

### Next Steps

- **Generate a prompt**: Learn about the prompt generator in the Anthropic Console and try your hand at getting Claude to generate a prompt for you.
- **Apply XML tags**: If you want to level up your prompt variable game, wrap them in XML tags.
- **Anthropic Console**: Check out the myriad prompt development tools available in the Anthropic Console.

- **Build with Claude**
- **Define success criteria**
- **Develop test cases**

### Prompt Engineering

#### Prefill Claude's Response for Greater Output Control

When using Claude, you have the unique ability to guide its responses by prefilling the Assistant message. This powerful technique allows you to direct Claude’s actions, skip preambles, enforce specific formats like JSON or XML, and even help Claude maintain character consistency in role-play scenarios.
In some cases where Claude is not performing as expected, a few prefilled sentences can vastly improve Claude’s performance. A little prefilling goes a long way!

#### How to Prefill Claude’s Response

To prefill, include the desired initial text in the Assistant message (Claude’s response will continue from where the Assistant message leaves off):

```python
import anthropic
client = anthropic.Anthropic()
response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
    max_tokens=1024,
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "What is your favorite color?"},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": "As an AI assistant, I don't have a favorite color, But if I had to pick, it would be green because"}  # Prefill here
    ]
)
```

### Examples

- **Example 1: Controlling Output Formatting and Skipping the Preamble**
  - Power user tip: Prefilling `{` forces Claude to skip the preamble and directly output the JSON object. This is cleaner, more concise, and easier for programs to parse without additional processing.
- **Example 2: Maintaining Character in Roleplay Scenarios**
  - Role-play tip: Prefilling a bracketed `[ROLE_NAME]` can remind Claude to stay in character, even for longer and more complex conversations. This is especially powerful when combined with role prompting in the system parameter.

## PROMPT ENGINEERING

### Long Context Prompting Tips

Claude’s extended context window (200K tokens for Claude 3 models) enables handling complex, data-rich tasks. This guide will help you leverage this power effectively.

#### Essential Tips for Long Context Prompts

- **Put longform data at the top:** Place your long documents and inputs (~20K+ tokens) near the top of your prompt, above your query, instructions, and examples. This can significantly improve Claude’s performance across all models.
- **Queries at the end can improve response quality** by up to 30% in tests, especially with complex, multi-document inputs.
- **Structure document content and metadata with XML tags:** When using multiple documents, wrap each document in `<document>` tags with `<document_content>` and `<source>` (and other metadata) subtags for clarity.
- **Ground responses in quotes:** For long document tasks, ask Claude to quote relevant parts of the documents first before carrying out its task. This helps Claude cut through the “noise” of the rest of the document’s contents.

### Example Multi-Document Structure

```xml
<document>
  <document_content>Your long document content here...</document_content>
  <source>Your source information here...</source>
</document>
```

### Example Quote Extraction

- Ask Claude to extract and quote relevant sections from the provided documents.

Examples are your secret weapon shortcut for getting Claude to generate exactly what you need. By providing a few well-crafted examples in your prompt, you can dramatically improve the accuracy, consistency, and quality of Claude’s outputs. This technique, known as few-shot or multishot prompting, is particularly effective for tasks that require structured outputs or adherence to specific formats.
**Power up your prompts:** Include 3-5 diverse, relevant examples to show Claude exactly what you want. More examples = better performance, especially for complex tasks.

#### Why Use Examples?

- **Accuracy:** Examples reduce misinterpretation of instructions.
- **Consistency:** Examples enforce uniform structure and style.
- **Performance:** Well-chosen examples boost Claude’s ability to handle complex tasks.

#### Crafting Effective Examples

For maximum effectiveness, make sure that your examples are:

- **Relevant:** Your examples mirror your actual use case.
- **Diverse:** Your examples cover edge cases and potential challenges, and vary enough that Claude doesn’t inadvertently pick up on unintended patterns.
- **Clear:** Your examples are wrapped in `<example>` tags (if multiple, nested within `<examples>` tags) for structure.
  Ask Claude to evaluate your examples for relevance, diversity, or clarity. Or have Claude generate more examples based on your initial set.
  **Example:** Analyzing customer feedback

## Formatted Text

## Prompt Caching in Claude API

### Overview

Prompt caching is a powerful feature that optimizes your API usage by allowing resuming from specific prefixes in your prompts. This approach significantly reduces processing time and costs for repetitive tasks or prompts with consistent elements.

### Example Implementation

Here’s an example of how to implement prompt caching with the Messages API using a `cache_control` block:

```shell
curl https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
  -H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  -H "anthropic-beta: prompt-caching-2024-07-31" \
  -d '{
    "model": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
    "max_tokens": 1024,
    "system": [
      {
        "type": "text",
        "text": "You are an AI assistant tasked with analyzing literary works. Your goal is to provide insightful commentary on themes, characters, and writing style.\n"
      },
      {
        "type": "text",
        "text": "<the entire contents of Pride and Prejudice>",
        "cache_control": {"type": "ephemeral"}
      }
    ],
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Analyze the major themes in Pride and Prejudice."
      }
    ]
  }'
```

In this example, the entire text of “Pride and Prejudice” is cached using the `cache_control` parameter. This enables reuse of this large text across multiple API calls without reprocessing it each time.

### How Prompt Caching Works

When you send a request with prompt caching enabled:

- The system checks if the prompt prefix is already cached from a recent query.
- If found, it uses the cached version, reducing processing time and costs.
- Otherwise, it processes the full prompt and caches the prefix for future use.

### Pricing

Prompt caching introduces a new pricing structure. The table below shows the price per token for each supported model:
| Model | Base Input Tokens | Cache Writes | Cache Hits | Output Tokens |

## Message Batches API

The Message Batches API is a powerful, cost-effective way to asynchronously process large volumes of Messages requests. This approach is well-suited to tasks that do not require immediate responses, reducing costs by 50% while increasing throughput.

### Message Batches API is in beta

We’re excited to announce that the Batches API is now in public beta! To access this feature, you’ll need to include the `anthropic-beta: message-batches-2024-09-24` header in your API requests, or use `client.beta.messages.batches` in your SDK calls.
We’ll be iterating on this open beta over the coming weeks, so we appreciate your feedback. Please share your ideas and suggestions using this form.
You can explore the API reference directly, in addition to this guide.

### How the Message Batches API works

When you send a request to the Message Batches API:

1. The system creates a new Message Batch with the provided Messages requests.
2. The batch is then processed asynchronously, with each request handled independently.
3. You can poll for the status of the batch and retrieve results when processing has ended for all requests.
   This is especially useful for bulk operations that don’t require immediate results, such as:

- Large-scale evaluations: Process thousands of test cases efficiently.
- Content moderation: Analyze large volumes of user-generated content asynchronously.
- Data analysis: Generate insights or summaries for large datasets.
- Bulk content generation: Create large amounts of text for various purposes (e.g., product descriptions, article summaries).

### Batch limitations

- A Message Batch is limited to either 10,000 Message requests or 32 MB in size, whichever is reached first.
- The batch takes up to 24 hours to generate responses, though processing may end sooner than this.
- Batches will expire if processing does not complete within 24 hours.
- Batch results are available for 29 days after creation.
- Batches are scoped to a Workspace.

### Supported models

The Message Batches API currently supports:

- Claude 3.5 Sonnet
- Claude 3.5 Haiku
- Claude 3 Haiku
- Claude 3 Opus

### What can be batched

Any request that you can make to the Messages API can be included in a batch. This includes:

- Vision
- Tool use
- System messages
- Multi-turn conversations
- Any beta features

### Pricing

The Batches API offers significant cost savings. All usage is charged at 50% of the standard API prices.
| Model | Batch Input | Batch Output |
|---------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Claude 3.5 Sonnet | $1.50 / MTok | $7.50 / MTok |
| Claude 3 Opus | $7.50 / MTok | $37.50 / MTok |
| Claude 3 Haiku | $0.125 / MTok | $0.625 / MTok |

### How to use the Message Batches API

#### Prepare and create your batch

A Message Batch is composed of a list of requests to create a Message. The shape of an individual request is comprised of:

- A unique `custom_id` for identifying the Messages request
- A `params` object with the standard Messages API parameters
  You can create a batch by passing this list into the `requests` parameter.

```python
import anthropic
from anthropic.types.beta.message_create_params import MessageCreateParamsNonStreaming
from anthropic.types.beta.messages.batch_create_params import Request
client = anthropic.Anthropic()
message_batch = client.beta.messages.batches.create(
    requests=[
        Request(
            custom_id="my-first-request",
            params=MessageCreateParamsNonStreaming(
                model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
                max_tokens=1024,
                messages=[{
                    "role": "user",
                    "content": "Hello, world",
                }]
            )
        ),
        Request(
            custom_id="my-second-request",
            params=MessageCreateParamsNonStreaming(
                model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
                max_tokens=1024,
                messages=[{
                    "role": "user",
                    "content": "Hi again, friend",
                }]
            )
        )
    ]
)
print(message_batch)
```

### Best practices for effective batching

- Monitor batch processing status regularly and implement appropriate retry logic for failed requests.
- Use meaningful `custom_id` values to easily match results with requests, since order is not guaranteed.
- Consider breaking very large datasets into multiple batches for better manageability.

### Troubleshooting common issues

- Verify that the total batch request size doesn’t exceed 32 MB.
- Ensure each request in the batch has a unique `custom_id`.
- Confirm that the batch has not been canceled.

### Batch storage and privacy

- Batches are isolated within the Workspace they are created in.
- Batch results are available for 29 days after the batch is created.

### FAQ

- How long does it take for a batch to process?
- Is the Batches API available for all models?
- How do I enable the Batches API?
- Can I use the Message Batches API with other API features?
- How does the Message Batches API affect pricing?

### Prompt Engineering

#### Let Claude Think (Chain of Thought Prompting)

When faced with complex tasks like research, analysis, or problem-solving, giving Claude space to think can dramatically improve its performance. This technique, known as chain of thought (CoT) prompting, encourages Claude to break down problems step-by-step, leading to more accurate and nuanced outputs.

#### Before Implementing CoT

- **Why Let Claude Think?**
  - **Accuracy**: Stepping through problems reduces errors, especially in math, logic, analysis, or generally complex tasks.
  - **Coherence**: Structured thinking leads to more cohesive, well-organized responses.
  - **Debugging**: Seeing Claude’s thought process helps you pinpoint where prompts may be unclear.
- **Why Not Let Claude Think?**
  - Increased output length may impact latency.
  - Not all tasks require in-depth thinking. Use CoT judiciously to ensure the right balance of performance and latency.
  - Use CoT for tasks that a human would need to think through, like complex math, multi-step analysis, writing complex documents, or decisions with many factors.

#### How to Prompt for Thinking

The chain of thought techniques below are ordered from least to most complex. Less complex methods take up less space in the context window, but are also generally less powerful.

- **CoT Tip**: Always have Claude output its thinking. Without outputting its thought process, no thinking occurs!
- **Basic Prompt**: Include “Think step-by-step” in your prompt.
- **Guided Prompt**: Outline specific steps for Claude to follow in its thinking process.
- **Structured Prompt**: Use XML tags like `<thinking>` and `<answer>` to separate reasoning from the final answer.

#### Examples

- **Example**: Financial analysis without thinking
- **Example**: Financial analysis with thinking

### Additional Resources

- **Prompt Library**: Get inspired by a curated selection of prompts for various tasks and use cases.
- **GitHub Prompting Tutorial**: An example-filled tutorial that covers the prompt engineering concepts found in our docs.

## Formatted Text

# PDF Support in Claude 3.5 Sonnet Models

The Claude 3.5 Sonnet models now support PDF input and understand both text and visual content within documents.

## PDF support is in public beta

To access this feature, include the `anthropic-beta: pdfs-2024-09-25` header in your API requests.
We’ll be iterating on this open beta over the coming weeks, so we appreciate your feedback. Please share your ideas and suggestions using this form.

### PDF Capabilities

Claude works with any standard PDF. You can ask Claude about any text, pictures, charts, and tables in the PDFs you provide. Some sample use cases include:

- Analyzing financial reports and understanding charts/tables
- Extracting key information from legal documents
- Translation assistance for documents
- Converting document information into structured formats

### How PDF Support Works

When you send a request that includes a PDF file:

1. The system extracts the contents of the document.
   - The system converts each page of the document into an image.
   - The text from each page is extracted and provided alongside the page’s image.
2. Claude analyzes both the text and images to better understand the document.
   - Documents are provided as a combination of text and images for analysis.
   - This allows users to ask for insights on visual elements of a PDF, such as charts, diagrams, and other non-textual content.
3. Use documents alongside other Claude features.
   - PDF support works well alongside:
     - Prompt caching: To improve performance for repeated analysis.
     - Batch processing: For high-volume document processing.
     - Tool use: To extract specific information from documents for use as tool inputs.

### PDF Support Limitations

Before integrating PDF support into your application, ensure your files meet these requirements:
| Requirement | Limit |
|----------------------------|------------------------|
| Maximum request size | 32MB |
| Maximum pages per request | 100 |
| Supported models | claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022, claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620 |
Please note that both limits are on the entire request payload, including any other content sent alongside PDFs. The provided PDFs should not have any passwords or encryption.
Since PDF support relies on Claude’s vision capabilities, it is subject to the same limitations.

### Supported Platforms and Models

PDF support is currently available on both Claude 3.5 Sonnet models (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022, claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620) via direct API access. This functionality will be supported on Amazon Bedrock and Google Vertex AI soon.

### Calculate Expected Token Usage

The token count of a PDF file depends on the total text extracted from the document as well as the number of pages. Since each page is converted into an image, the same image-based cost calculations are applied. Each page typically uses 1,500 to 3,000 tokens, depending on content density. Standard input token pricing applies, with no additional fees for PDF processing.
You can also use token counting to determine the number of tokens in a message containing PDFs.

### How to Use PDFs in the Messages API

Here’s a simple example demonstrating how to use PDFs in the Messages API:

- PDF support with prompt caching
- PDF support with the Message Batches API

### Best Practices for PDF Analysis

- Ensure text is clear and legible.
- Rotate pages to the proper orientation.
- When referring to page numbers, use the logical number (the number reported by your PDF viewer) rather than the physical page number (the number visible on the page).
- Use standard fonts.
- Place PDFs before text in requests.
- Split very large PDFs into smaller chunks when limits are exceeded.
- Use prompt caching for repeated analysis of the same document.

Channel Name: Anthropic
Published At: Not available
Processing Style: technical

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Summary
This guide provides a comprehensive overview of how to utilize Claude's advanced natural language understanding capabilities for classifying customer support tickets. It outlines the indicators for using Claude, the steps to build and deploy a support workflow, and the importance of defining user intent categories and success criteria.

## Tags
natural language processing, ticket routing, customer support, machine learning, Claude, automation

## Key Points
- Claude is suitable for ticket routing when labeled training data is limited and classification categories may evolve.
- Understanding existing support workflows is essential before implementing automation.
- Clearly defined user intent categories enhance the accuracy of ticket classification.
- Establishing measurable success criteria is crucial for evaluating the effectiveness of the LLM.
- Selecting the appropriate Claude model is important based on cost, accuracy, and response time.
- Prompt engineering plays a vital role in the classification process.

## Formatted Text
## Define whether to use Claude for ticket routing
This guide walks through how to harness Claude’s advanced natural language understanding capabilities to classify customer support tickets at scale based on customer intent, urgency, prioritization, customer profile, and more.
### Indicators for Using Claude
Here are some key indicators that you should use an LLM like Claude instead of traditional ML approaches for your classification task:
- Limited labeled training data available
- Classification categories likely to change or evolve over time
- Need to handle complex, unstructured text inputs
- Classification rules based on semantic understanding
- Requirement for interpretable reasoning for classification decisions
- Desire to handle edge cases and ambiguous tickets more effectively
- Need for multilingual support without maintaining separate models
## Build and deploy your LLM support workflow
### Understand your current support approach
Before diving into automation, it’s crucial to understand your existing ticketing system. Start by investigating how your support team currently handles ticket routing.
Consider questions like:
- What criteria are used to determine what SLA/service offering is applied?
- Is ticket routing used to determine which tier of support or product specialist a ticket goes to?
- Are there any automated rules or workflows already in place? In what cases do they fail?
- How are edge cases or ambiguous tickets handled?
- How does the team prioritize tickets?
The more you know about how humans handle certain cases, the better you will be able to work with Claude to do the task.
### Define user intent categories
A well-defined list of user intent categories is crucial for accurate support ticket classification with Claude. Here are some example user intent categories and subcategories:
- Technical issue
- Account management
- Product information
- User guidance
- Feedback
- Order-related
- Service request
- Security concerns
- Compliance and legal
- Emergency support
- Training and education
- Integration and API
### Establish success criteria
Work with your support team to define clear success criteria with measurable benchmarks, thresholds, and goals. Here are some standard criteria and benchmarks when using LLMs for support ticket routing:
- Classification consistency
- Adaptation speed
- Multilingual handling
- Edge case handling
- Bias mitigation
- Prompt efficiency
- Explainability score
## Choose the right Claude model
The choice of model depends on the trade-offs between cost, accuracy, and response time. Many customers have found `claude-3-haiku-20240307` an ideal model for ticket routing, as it is the fastest and most cost-effective model in the Claude 3 family while still delivering excellent results.
## Build a strong prompt
Ticket routing is a type of classification task. Claude analyzes the content of a support ticket and classifies it into predefined categories based on the issue type, urgency, required expertise, or other relevant factors.
Here’s an example ticket routing classification prompt:
```python
def classify_support_request(ticket_contents):
    classification_prompt = f"""You will be acting as a customer support ticket classification system. Your task is to analyze customer support requests and output the appropriate classification intent for each request, along with your reasoning.
    Here is the customer support request you need to classify:
    <request>{ticket_contents}</request>
    Please carefully analyze the above request to determine the customer's core intent and needs. Consider what the customer is asking for has concerns about.
    First, write out your reasoning and analysis of how to classify this request inside <reasoning> tags.
    Then, output the appropriate classification label for the request inside a <intent> tag. The valid intents are:
    <intents>
    <intent>Support, Feedback, Complaint</intent>
    <intent>Order Tracking</intent>
    <intent>Refund/Exchange</intent>
    </intents>
    A request may have ONLY ONE applicable intent. Only include the intent that is most applicable to the request.
    """
````

## Deploy your prompt

It’s hard to know how well your prompt works without deploying it in a test production setting and running evaluations.

## Evaluate your prompt

Prompting often requires testing and optimization for it to be production ready. To determine the readiness of your solution, evaluate performance based on the success criteria and thresholds you established earlier.

## Build an evaluation function

Our example evaluation for this guide measures Claude’s performance along three key metrics:

- Accuracy
- Cost per classification

```python
import anthropic
import re
client = anthropic.Anthropic()
DEFAULT_MODEL="claude-3-haiku-20240307"
def classify_support_request(request, actual_intent):
    classification_prompt = f"""You will be acting as a customer support ticket classification system.
    ...
    ...The reasoning should be enclosed in <reasoning> tags and the intent in <intent> tags. Return only the reasoning and the intent.
    """
    message = client.messages.create(
        model=DEFAULT_MODEL,
        max_tokens=500,
        temperature=0,
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": classification_prompt}],
    )
    usage = message.usage
    reasoning_and_intent = message.content[0].text
    reasoning_match = re.search(r"<reasoning>(.*?)</reasoning>", reasoning_and_intent, re.DOTALL)
    reasoning = reasoning_match.group(1).strip() if reasoning_match else ""
    intent_match = re.search(r"<intent>(.*?)</intent>", reasoning_and_intent, re.DOTALL)
    intent = intent_match.group(1).strip() if intent_match else ""
    correct = actual_intent.strip() == intent.strip()
    return reasoning, intent, correct, usage
```

## Run your evaluation

A proper evaluation requires clear thresholds and benchmarks to determine what is a good result.

## Improve performance

In complex scenarios, it may be helpful to consider additional strategies to improve performance beyond standard prompt engineering techniques & guardrail implementation strategies.

### Use a taxonomic hierarchy for cases with 20+ intent categories

As the number of classes grows, the number of examples required also expands, potentially making the prompt unwieldy.

### Use vector databases and similarity search retrieval to handle highly variable tickets

If support requests are highly variable, it can be hard to include enough examples in a single prompt.

### Account specifically for expected edge cases

Consider providing explicit instructions or examples in the prompt of how Claude should handle edge cases.

## Integrate Claude into your greater support workflow

Proper integration requires that you make some decisions regarding how your Claude-based ticket routing script fits into the architecture of your greater ticket routing system.

### Push-based

The support ticket system triggers your code by sending a webhook event to your routing service.

### Pull-Based

Your code pulls for the latest tickets based on a given schedule and routes them at pull time.

# Anthropic Computer Use Documentation
## Overview
The upgraded Claude 3.5 Sonnet model is capable of interacting with tools that can manipulate a computer desktop environment. Computer use is a beta feature. Please be aware that computer use poses unique risks that are distinct from standard API features or chat interfaces.
### Precautions
To minimize risks, consider taking precautions such as:
- Use a dedicated virtual machine or container with minimal privileges to prevent direct system attacks or accidents.
- Avoid giving the model access to sensitive data, such as account login information, to prevent information theft.
- Limit internet access to an allowlist of domains to reduce exposure to malicious content.
- Ask a human to confirm decisions that may result in meaningful real-world consequences.
In some circumstances, Claude will follow commands found in content even if it conflicts with the user’s instructions. We suggest taking precautions to isolate Claude from sensitive data and actions to avoid risks related to prompt injection.
### Computer Use Reference Implementation
Get started quickly with our computer use reference implementation that includes a web interface, Docker container, example tool implementations, and an agent loop.
### Example API Call
Here’s an example of how to provide computer use tools to Claude using the Messages API:
```bash
curl https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
  -H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  -H "anthropic-beta: computer-use-2024-10-22" \
  -d '{
    "model": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
    "max_tokens": 1024,
    "tools": [
      {
        "type": "computer_20241022",
        "name": "computer",
        "display_width_px": 1024,
        "display_height_px": 768,
        "display_number": 1
      },
      {
        "type": "text_editor_20241022",
        "name": "str_replace_editor"
      },
      {
        "type": "bash_20241022",
        "name": "bash"
      }
    ],
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Save a picture of a cat to my desktop."
      }
    ]
  }'
````

### How Computer Use Works

1. **Provide Claude with computer use tools and a user prompt:** Add Anthropic-defined computer use tools to your API request.
2. **Claude decides to use a tool:** Claude assesses if any tools can help with the user’s query.
3. **Extract tool input, evaluate the tool on a computer, and return results:** Extract the tool name and input from Claude’s request and evaluate it.
4. **Claude continues calling computer use tools until the task is completed:** Claude analyzes the tool results and determines if more tool use is needed.

### Implementation Guidelines

Start with our reference implementation that includes:

- A containerized environment suitable for computer use with Claude.
- Implementations of the computer use tools.
- An agent loop that interacts with the Anthropic API.

### Optimize Model Performance with Prompting

- Specify simple, well-defined tasks and provide explicit instructions for each step.
- Use screenshots and tool calls of successful outcomes in your prompt.
- Provide login credentials in xml tags to mitigate risks.

### System Prompts

When one of the Anthropic-defined tools is requested, a computer use-specific system prompt is generated.

### Understand Anthropic-defined Tools

Anthropic-defined tools are user-executed and must be explicitly evaluated for results.

### Limitations

- Latency may be an issue for human-AI interactions.
- Computer vision and tool selection accuracy may vary.
- Scrolling and spreadsheet interactions can be unreliable.

### Pricing

Computer use requests are priced the same as any other Claude API request.

## Summary

This document serves as a guide for creating effective evaluations and test cases for measuring the performance of large language models (LLMs) against defined success criteria. It outlines principles for evaluation design, grading methods, and tips for leveraging LLMs in the grading process.

## Tags

LLM, evaluation, prompt engineering, test cases, grading methods, empirical evaluations

## Key Points

- Define success criteria before designing evaluations.
- Use task-specific evaluations that reflect real-world scenarios.
- Automate grading where possible to enhance efficiency.
- Employ various grading methods, including code-based, human, and LLM-based grading.
- Develop clear rubrics for LLM-based grading to improve reliability.

## Formatted Text

# BUILD WITH CLAUDE

## Create strong empirical evaluations

After defining your success criteria, the next step is designing evaluations to measure LLM performance against those criteria. This is a vital part of the prompt engineering cycle.
This guide focuses on how to develop your test cases.

### Building evals and test cases

#### Eval design principles

- **Be task-specific:** Design evals that mirror your real-world task distribution. Don’t forget to factor in edge cases!
  **Example edge cases**
- **Automate when possible:** Structure questions to allow for automated grading (e.g., multiple-choice, string match, code-graded, LLM-graded).
- **Prioritize volume over quality:** More questions with slightly lower signal automated grading is better than fewer questions with high-quality human hand-graded evals.

#### Example evals

- **Task fidelity (sentiment analysis):** exact match evaluation
- **Consistency (FAQ bot):** cosine similarity evaluation
- **Relevance and coherence (summarization):** ROUGE-L evaluation
- **Tone and style (customer service):** LLM-based Likert scale
- **Privacy preservation (medical chatbot):** LLM-based binary classification
- **Context utilization (conversation assistant):** LLM-based ordinal scale
  Writing hundreds of test cases can be hard to do by hand! Get Claude to help you generate more from a baseline set of example test cases. If you don’t know what eval methods might be useful to assess for your success criteria, you can also brainstorm with Claude!

### Grading evals

When deciding which method to use to grade evals, choose the fastest, most reliable, most scalable method:

- **Code-based grading:** Fastest and most reliable, extremely scalable, but also lacks nuance for more complex judgements that require less rule-based rigidity.
- **Exact match:** output == golden_answer
- **String match:** key_phrase in output
- **Human grading:** Most flexible and high quality, but slow and expensive. Avoid if possible.
- **LLM-based grading:** Fast and flexible, scalable and suitable for complex judgement. Test to ensure reliability first then scale.

### Tips for LLM-based grading

- **Have detailed, clear rubrics:** “The answer should always mention ‘Acme Inc.’ in the first sentence. If it does not, the answer is automatically graded as ‘incorrect.’”
- A given use case, or even a specific success criteria for that use case, might require several rubrics for holistic evaluation.
- **Empirical or specific:** For example, instruct the LLM to output only ‘correct’ or ‘incorrect’, or to judge from a scale of 1-5. Purely qualitative evaluations are hard to assess quickly and at scale.
- **Encourage reasoning:** Ask the LLM to think first before deciding an evaluation score, and then discard the reasoning. This increases evaluation performance, particularly for tasks requiring complex judgement.

### Example: LLM-based grading

### Next steps

- **Brainstorm evaluations**
- **Learn how to craft prompts that maximize your eval scores.**
- **Evals cookbook:** More code examples of human-, code-, and LLM-graded evals.

## Formatted Text

# Claude for Sheets User Guide

## Why use Claude for Sheets?

Claude for Sheets enables prompt engineering at scale by allowing you to test prompts across evaluation suites in parallel. It excels at office tasks like survey analysis and online data processing.
Visit our prompt engineering example sheet to see this in action.

## Get started with Claude for Sheets

### Install Claude for Sheets

Easily enable Claude for Sheets using the following steps:

1. **Get your Anthropic API key**  
   If you don’t yet have an API key, you can create one in the Anthropic Console.
2. **Install the Claude for Sheets extension**  
   Find the Claude for Sheets extension in the add-on marketplace, then click the blue Install button and accept the permissions.
3. **Connect your API key**  
   Enter your API key at `Extensions > Claude for Sheets™ > Open sidebar > ☰ > Settings > API provider`. You may need to wait or refresh for the Claude for Sheets menu to appear.  
   _Note: You will have to re-enter your API key every time you create a new Google Sheet._

### Enter your first prompt

There are two main functions you can use to call Claude using Claude for Sheets. For now, let’s use `CLAUDE()`.

1. **Simple prompt**  
   In any cell, type `=CLAUDE("Claude, in one sentence, what's good about the color blue?")`  
   Claude should respond with an answer. You will know the prompt is processing because the cell will say Loading...
2. **Adding parameters**  
   Parameter arguments come after the initial prompt, like `=CLAUDE(prompt, model, params...)`.  
   The model is always second in the list.  
   Now type in any cell `=CLAUDE("Hi, Claude!", "claude-3-haiku-20240307", "max_tokens", 3)`  
   Any API parameter can be set this way. You can even pass in an API key for this specific cell, like this: `"api_key", "sk-ant-api03-j1W..."`.

### Advanced use

`CLAUDEMESSAGES` is a function that allows you to specifically use the Messages API. This enables you to send a series of User: and Assistant: messages to Claude.
Try writing this in a cell:

```
=CLAUDEMESSAGES("User: In one sentence, what is good about the color blue?
Assistant: The color blue is great because")
```

#### Newlines

Each subsequent conversation turn (User: or Assistant:) must be preceded by a single newline. To enter newlines in a cell, use the following key combinations:

- Mac: Cmd + Enter
- Windows: Alt + Enter

### Optional function parameters

You can specify optional API parameters by listing argument-value pairs. You can set multiple parameters. Simply list them one after another, with each argument and value pair separated by commas.
The first two parameters must always be the prompt and the model. You cannot set an optional parameter without also setting the model.

#### Common parameters:

- **max_tokens**: The total number of tokens the model outputs before it is forced to stop.
- **temperature**: The amount of randomness injected into results.
- **system**: Used to specify a system prompt.
- **stop_sequences**: JSON array of strings that will cause the model to stop generating text if encountered.
- **api_key**: Used to specify a particular API key with which to call Claude.

### Claude for Sheets usage examples

- **Prompt engineering interactive tutorial**: Our in-depth prompt engineering interactive tutorial utilizes Claude for Sheets. You will need an API key to interact with the tutorial.
- **Prompt engineering workflow**: Our Claude for Sheets prompting examples workbench is a Claude-powered spreadsheet that houses example prompts and prompt engineering structures.
- **Claude for Sheets workbook template**: Make a copy of our Claude for Sheets workbook template to get started with your own Claude for Sheets work!

### Troubleshooting

- **NAME? Error**: Unknown function: 'claude'
- **#ERROR!, ⚠ DEFERRED ⚠ or ⚠ THROTTLED ⚠**: Can't enter API key

## Formatted Text

## BUILD WITH CLAUDE

### Define your success criteria

Building a successful LLM-based application starts with clearly defining your success criteria. How will you know when your application is good enough to publish?
Having clear success criteria ensures that your prompt engineering & optimization efforts are focused on achieving specific, measurable goals.

### Building strong criteria

Good success criteria are:

- **Specific**: Clearly define what you want to achieve. Instead of “good performance,” specify “accurate sentiment classification.”
- **Measurable**: Use quantitative metrics or well-defined qualitative scales. Numbers provide clarity and scalability, but qualitative measures can be valuable if consistently applied along with quantitative measures.
  Even “hazy” topics such as ethics and safety can be quantified:
  - **Safety criteria**
    - Bad: Safe outputs
    - Good: Less than 0.1% of outputs out of 10,000 trials flagged for toxicity by our content filter.
- **Achievable**: Base your targets on industry benchmarks, prior experiments, AI research, or expert knowledge. Your success metrics should not be unrealistic to current frontier model capabilities.
- **Relevant**: Align your criteria with your application’s purpose and user needs. Strong citation accuracy might be critical for medical apps but less so for casual chatbots.

### Common success criteria to consider

Here are some criteria that might be important for your use case. This list is non-exhaustive.

- Task fidelity
- Consistency
- Relevance and coherence
- Tone and style
- Privacy preservation
- Context utilization
- Latency
- Price
  Most use cases will need multidimensional evaluation along several success criteria.

## Legal Summarization with Claude

This guide walks through how to leverage Claude’s advanced natural language processing capabilities to efficiently summarize legal documents, extracting key information and expediting legal research. With Claude, you can streamline the review of contracts, litigation prep, and regulatory work, saving time and ensuring accuracy in your legal processes.
Visit our summarization cookbook to see an example legal summarization implementation using Claude.

### Before building with Claude

#### Decide whether to use Claude for legal summarization

Here are some key indicators that you should employ an LLM like Claude to summarize legal documents:

- You want to review a high volume of documents efficiently and affordably.
- You require automated extraction of key metadata.
- You want to generate clear, concise, and standardized summaries.
- You need precise citations for your summaries.
- You want to streamline and expedite your legal research process.

#### Determine the details you want the summarization to extract

There is no single correct summary for any given document. Without clear direction, it can be difficult for Claude to determine which details to include. To achieve optimal results, identify the specific information you want to include in the summary.
For instance, when summarizing a sublease agreement, you might wish to extract the following key points:

```python
details_to_extract = [
    'Parties involved (sublessor, sublessee, and original lessor)',
    'Property details (address, description, and permitted use)',
    'Term and rent (start date, end date, monthly rent, and security deposit)',
    'Responsibilities (utilities, maintenance, and repairs)',
    'Consent and notices (landlord\'s consent, and notice requirements)',
    'Special provisions (furniture, parking, and subletting restrictions)'
]
```

#### Establish success criteria

Evaluating the quality of summaries is a notoriously challenging task. Here are criteria you may wish to consider when assessing how well Claude performs legal summarization:

- Factual correctness
- Legal precision
- Conciseness
- Consistency
- Readability
- Bias and fairness

### How to summarize legal documents using Claude

#### Select the right Claude model

Model accuracy is extremely important when summarizing legal documents. Claude 3.5 Sonnet is an excellent choice for use cases such as this where high accuracy is required.
To help estimate costs, below is a comparison of the cost to summarize 1,000 sublease agreements using both Sonnet and Haiku:
| Model | Input Token Cost | Output Token Cost | Total Cost |
|---------------------|------------------|-------------------|------------|
| Claude 3.5 Sonnet | $258.00 | $5.25 | $263.25 |
| Claude 3 Haiku | $21.50 | $0.44 | $21.96 |

#### Transform documents into a format that Claude can process

Before you begin summarizing documents, you need to prepare your data. This involves extracting text from PDFs, cleaning the text, and ensuring it’s ready to be processed by Claude.
Here is a demonstration of this process on a sample pdf:

```python
from io import BytesIO
import re
import pypdf
import requests
def get_llm_text(pdf_file):
    reader = pypdf.PdfReader(pdf_file)
    text = "\n".join([page.extract_text() for page in reader.pages])
    text = re.sub(r'\s+', ' ', text)
    text = re.sub(r'\n\s*\d+\s*\n', '\n', text)
    return text
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anthropics/anthropic-cookbook/main/skills/summarization/data/Sample Sublease Agreement.pdf"
response = requests.get(url)
pdf_file = BytesIO(response.content)
document_text = get_llm_text(pdf_file)
print(document_text[:50000])
```

#### Build a strong prompt

Claude can adapt to various summarization styles. Here’s an example of how to create a prompt that ensures the generated summaries follow a consistent structure:

```python
import anthropic
client = anthropic.Anthropic()
def summarize_document(text, details_to_extract, model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022", max_tokens=1000):
    details_to_extract_str = '\n'.join(details_to_extract)
    prompt = f"""Summarize the following sublease agreement. Focus on these key aspects:
    {details_to_extract_str}
    Provide the summary in bullet points nested within the XML header for each section. For example:
    <parties involved>
    - Sublessor: [Name]
    // Add more details as needed
    </parties involved>
    If any information is not explicitly stated in the document, note it as "Not specified". Do not preamble.
    Sublease agreement text:
    {text}
    """
    response = client.messages.create(
        model=model,
        max_tokens=max_tokens,
        system="You are a legal analyst specializing in real estate law, known for highly accurate and detailed summaries of sublease agreements.",
        messages=[
            {"role": "user", "content": prompt},
            {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here is the summary of the sublease agreement: <summary>"}
        ],
        stop_sequences=["</summary>"]
    )
    return response.content[0].text
sublease_summary = summarize_document(document_text, details_to_extract)
print(sublease_summary)
```

#### Evaluate your prompt

Prompting often requires testing and optimization for it to be production-ready. Metrics you may wish to include in your empirical evaluation:

- ROUGE scores
- BLEU scores
- Contextual embedding similarity
- LLM-based grading

## Content Moderation with Claude

### Overview

Content moderation is a critical aspect of maintaining a safe, respectful, and productive environment in digital applications. In this guide, we’ll discuss how Claude can be used to moderate content within your digital application.

### Before Building with Claude

#### Decide Whether to Use Claude for Content Moderation

Here are some key indicators that you should use an LLM like Claude instead of a traditional ML or rules-based approach for content moderation:

- You want a cost-effective and rapid implementation
- You desire both semantic understanding and quick decisions
- You need consistent policy decisions
- Your moderation policies are likely to change or evolve over time
- You require interpretable reasoning for your moderation decisions
- You need multilingual support without maintaining separate models
- You require multimodal support

### Generate Examples of Content to Moderate

Before developing a content moderation solution, first create examples of content that should be flagged and content that should not be flagged. Ensure that you include edge cases and challenging scenarios that may be difficult for a content moderation system to handle effectively.
For instance, the examples generated by a social media platform might include the following:

```python
allowed_user_comments = [
    'This movie was great, I really enjoyed it. The main actor really killed it!',
    'I hate Mondays.',
    'It is a great time to invest in gold!'
]
disallowed_user_comments = [
    'Delete this post now or you better hide. I am coming after you and your family.',
    'Stay away from the 5G cellphones!! They are using 5G to control you.',
    'Congratulations! You have won a $1,000 gift card. Click here to claim your prize!'
]
```
````

### How to Moderate Content Using Claude

#### Select the Right Claude Model

When selecting a model, it’s important to consider the size of your data. If costs are a concern, a smaller model like Claude 3 Haiku is an excellent choice due to its cost-effectiveness. Below is an estimate of the cost to moderate text for a social media platform that receives one billion posts per month:
**Estimated Costs:**

- **Claude 3 Haiku:** Monthly cost: $2,590
- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet:** Monthly cost: $31,080

#### Build a Strong Prompt

In order to use Claude for content moderation, Claude must understand the moderation requirements of your application. Here’s an example of a prompt to define moderation needs:

```python
import anthropic
import json
# Initialize the Anthropic client
client = anthropic.Anthropic()
def moderate_message(message, unsafe_categories):
    # Convert the list of unsafe categories into a string
    unsafe_category_str = '\n'.join(unsafe_categories)
    # Construct the prompt for Claude
    assessment_prompt = f"""
    Determine whether the following message warrants moderation,
    based on the unsafe categories outlined below.
    Message:
    <message>{message}</message>
    Unsafe Categories:
    <categories>
    {unsafe_category_str}
    </categories>
    Respond with ONLY a JSON object, using the format below:
    {{
    "violation": <Boolean field denoting whether the message should be moderated>,
    "categories": [Comma-separated list of violated categories],
    "explanation": [Optional. Only include if there is a violation.]
    }}"""
```

### Evaluate Your Prompt

Content moderation is a classification problem. Thus, you can use the same techniques outlined in our classification cookbook to determine the accuracy of your content moderation system.

### Deploy Your Prompt

Once you are confident in the quality of your solution, it’s time to deploy it to production. Here are some best practices to follow:

- Provide clear feedback to users when their input is blocked.
- Analyze moderated content to identify trends.
- Continuously evaluate and improve the moderation system.

### Improve Performance

Consider additional strategies to improve performance beyond standard prompt engineering techniques, such as defining topics and providing examples, and considering batch processing for efficiency.

### Conclusion

This guide serves as a foundational resource for implementing content moderation using Claude, ensuring a safer digital environment for users.

# Anthropic API Streaming Documentation
ID: N/A
Channel Name: Anthropic
Published At: N/A
Processing Style: technical

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Summary
This document provides detailed information on how to use the Anthropic API for streaming messages, including event types, error handling, and examples of basic and tool-use streaming requests.

## Tags
Anthropic API, Streaming, Server-Sent Events, SDK, JSON, Tool Use, Error Handling

## Key Points
- The API supports streaming responses using server-sent events (SSE).
- Multiple SDKs (Python and TypeScript) facilitate streaming with various options.
- Event types include message_start, content_block_start, content_block_delta, and message_stop.
- Error events can occur during high usage, indicated by specific error types.
- Streaming requests can include tool use, allowing for dynamic interactions.

## Formatted Text
# Streaming Messages
When creating a Message, you can set `"stream": true` to incrementally stream the response using server-sent events (SSE).
## Streaming with SDKs
Our Python and TypeScript SDKs offer multiple ways of streaming. The Python SDK allows both sync and async streams. See the documentation in each SDK for details.
## Event Types
Each server-sent event includes a named event type and associated JSON data. Each event will use an SSE event name (e.g., `event: message_stop`), and include the matching event type in its data.
### Event Flow
- `message_start`: contains a Message object with empty content.
- A series of content blocks, each of which have:
  - `content_block_start`
  - One or more `content_block_delta` events
  - `content_block_stop`
- One or more `message_delta` events, indicating top-level changes to the final Message object.
- A final `message_stop` event.
### Ping Events
Event streams may also include any number of ping events.
### Error Events
We may occasionally send errors in the event stream. For example, during periods of high usage, you may receive an `overloaded_error`, which would normally correspond to an HTTP 529 in a non-streaming context:
```json
event: error
data: {"type": "error", "error": {"type": "overloaded_error", "message": "Overloaded"}}
````

### Other Events

In accordance with our versioning policy, we may add new event types, and your code should handle unknown event types gracefully.

## Delta Types

Each `content_block_delta` event contains a delta of a type that updates the content block at a given index.

### Text Delta

A text content block delta looks like:

```json
event: content_block_delta
data: {"type": "content_block_delta","index": 0,"delta": {"type": "text_delta", "text": "ello frien"}}
```

### Input JSON Delta

The deltas for tool_use content blocks correspond to updates for the input field of the block. To support maximum granularity, the deltas are partial JSON strings, whereas the final `tool_use.input` is always an object.
A tool_use content block delta looks like:

```json
event: content_block_delta
data: {"type": "content_block_delta","index": 1,"delta": {"type": "input_json_delta","partial_json": "{\"location\": \"San Fra"}}
```

Note: Our current models only support emitting one complete key and value property from input at a time. As such, when using tools, there may be delays between streaming events while the model is working.

## Raw HTTP Stream Response

We strongly recommend that you use our client SDKs when using streaming mode. However, if you are building a direct API integration, you will need to handle these events yourself.
A stream response is comprised of:

- A `message_start` event
- Potentially multiple content blocks, each of which contains:
  - A `content_block_start` event
  - Potentially multiple `content_block_delta` events
  - A `content_block_stop` event
- A `message_delta` event
- A `message_stop` event
  There may be ping events dispersed throughout the response as well.

## Basic Streaming Request

### Request

```bash
curl https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages \

This document provides an overview of the legacy Text Completions API from Anthropic, detailing how to create text completions, stream responses, and handle events and errors. It emphasizes the importance of migrating to the Messages API for future models and features.

## Tags

API, Text Completions, Streaming, Server-Sent Events, JSON, Error Handling

## Key Points

- The Text Completions API is a legacy API; migration to the Messages API is recommended.
- Responses can be streamed using server-sent events (SSE) by setting "stream": true.
- Example requests and responses are provided for clarity.
- Different event types are defined, including completion, ping, and error.
- Older API versions may have different response shapes.

## Formatted Text

## Text Completions (Legacy)

The Text Completions API is a legacy API. Future models and features will require use of the Messages API, and we recommend migrating as soon as possible.

### Creating a Text Completion

When creating a Text Completion, you can set `"stream": true` to incrementally stream the response using server-sent events (SSE). If you are using our client libraries, parsing these events will be handled for you automatically. However, if you are building a direct API integration, you will need to handle these events yourself.

#### Example

**Request**

```bash
curl https://api.anthropic.com/v1/complete \
     --header "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
     --header "content-type: application/json" \
     --header "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
     --data '
{
  "model": "claude-2",
  "prompt": "\n\nHuman: Hello, world!\n\nAssistant:",
  "max_tokens_to_sample": 256,
  "stream": true
}
'
```

**Response**

```
event: completion
data: {"type": "completion", "completion": " Hello", "stop_reason": null, "model": "claude-2.0"}
event: completion
data: {"type": "completion", "completion": "!", "stop_reason": null, "model": "claude-2.0"}
event: ping
data: {"type": "ping"}
event: completion
data: {"type": "completion", "completion": " My", "stop_reason": null, "model": "claude-2.0"}
event: completion
data: {"type": "completion", "completion": " name", "stop_reason": null, "model": "claude-2.0"}
event: completion
data: {"type": "completion", "completion": " is", "stop_reason": null, "model": "claude-2.0"}
event: completion
data: {"type": "completion", "completion": " Claude", "stop_reason": null, "model": "claude-2.0"}
event: completion
data: {"type": "completion", "completion": ".", "stop_reason": null, "model": "claude-2.0"}
event: completion
data: {"type": "completion", "completion": "", "stop_reason": "stop_sequence", "model": "claude-2.0"}
```

### Events

Each event includes a named event type and associated JSON data.
**Event types:** completion, ping, error.

### Error Event Types

We may occasionally send errors in the event stream. For example, during periods of high usage, you may receive an `overloaded_error`, which would normally correspond to an HTTP 529 in a non-streaming context:
**Example error**

```
event: completion
data: {"completion": " Hello", "stop_reason": null, "model": "claude-2.0"}
event: error
data: {"error": {"type": "overloaded_error", "message": "Overloaded"}}
```

### Older API Versions

If you are using an API version prior to 2023-06-01, the response shape will be different. See versioning for details.

## Summary

This document provides an overview of the Anthropic API, including versioning requirements, changes in the latest version, and guidelines for making API requests.

## Tags

API, versioning, server-sent events, error handling, client libraries

## Key Points

- API requests must include the anthropic-version request header.
- The latest version is recommended for use to avoid deprecated features.
- Version 2023-06-01 introduces new formats for streaming server-sent events.
- Previous versions may be unavailable for new users.

## Formatted Text

# Anthropic API Documentation

## Using the API

When making API requests, you must send an `anthropic-version` request header. For example:

```
anthropic-version: 2023-06-01
```

If you are using our client libraries, this is handled for you automatically.

### Version Preservation

For any given API version, we will preserve:

- Existing input parameters
- Existing output parameters
  However, we may do the following:
- Add additional optional inputs
- Add additional values to the output
- Change conditions for specific error types
- Add new variants to enum-like output values (for example, streaming event types)
  Generally, if you are using the API as documented in this reference, we will not break your usage.

## Version History

We always recommend using the latest API version whenever possible. Previous versions are considered deprecated and may be unavailable for new users.

### 2023-06-01

- New format for streaming server-sent events (SSE):
  - Completions are incremental. For example, "Hello", "my", "name", "is", "Claude." instead of "Hello", "Hello my", "Hello my name", "Hello my name is", "Hello my name is Claude."
  - All events are named events, rather than data-only events.
  - Removed unnecessary data: [DONE] event.
  - Removed legacy exception and truncated values in responses.

### 2023-01-01

- Initial release.

# Anthropic API Rate Limits and Usage Guidelines

ID: N/A
Channel Name: Anthropic
Published At: N/A
Processing Style: technical

---

## Summary

This document outlines the rate limits and spend limits associated with the Anthropic API, detailing how these limits are structured, enforced, and the implications for organizations using the service. It provides insights into tier advancement requirements, response headers, and legacy rate limits.

## Tags

API, Rate Limits, Spend Limits, Token Management, Claude API, Usage Tiers

## Key Points

- Two types of limits: spend limits and rate limits.
- Spend limits restrict monthly costs for API usage.
- Rate limits define the maximum number of API requests over time.
- Limits are enforced at the organization level, with options for user-configurable limits.
- The token bucket algorithm is used for rate limiting.
- Custom limits can be set for individual Workspaces to ensure equitable resource distribution.

## Formatted Text

# Using the API

## Rate Limits

To mitigate against misuse and manage capacity on our API, we have implemented limits on how much an organization can use the Claude API.

### Types of Limits

1. **Spend Limits**: Set a maximum monthly cost an organization can incur for API usage.
2. **Rate Limits**: Set the maximum number of API requests an organization can make over a defined period of time.

### Enforcement

- Service-configured limits are enforced at the organization level.
- User-configurable limits can be set for workspaces.

## About Our Limits

- Limits are designed to prevent API abuse while minimizing impact on common customer usage patterns.
- Defined by usage tier, with each tier having different spend and rate limits.
- Organizations automatically increase tiers as they reach certain thresholds.
- Rate limits may be enforced as bursts of requests can surpass the limit, leading to errors.

## Spend Limits

Each usage tier has a limit on how much you can spend on the API each calendar month. Once you reach the spend limit of your tier, you will have to wait until the next month to use the API again.

### Requirements to Advance Tier

| Usage Tier        | Credit Purchase | Wait After First Purchase | Max Usage per Month |
| ----------------- | --------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Tier 1            | $5              | 0 days                    | $100                |
| Tier 2            | $40             | 7 days                    | $500                |
| Tier 3            | $200            | 7 days                    | $1,000              |
| Tier 4            | $400            | 14 days                   | $5,000              |
| Monthly Invoicing | N/A             | N/A                       | N/A                 |

## Updated Rate Limits

Rate limits are measured in requests per minute, input tokens per minute, and output tokens per minute for each model class. Exceeding any of the rate limits results in a 429 error.

### Rate Limits per Model

| Model             | Maximum RPM | Maximum ITPM | Maximum OTPM |
| ----------------- | ----------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| Claude 3.5 Sonnet | 50          | 40,000       | 8,000        |
| Claude 3.5 Haiku  | 50          | 50,000       | 10,000       |
| Claude 3 Opus     | 50          | 20,000       | 4,000        |

## Setting Lower Limits for Workspaces

Custom spend and rate limits can be set per Workspace to protect against overuse.

### Note:

- Default Workspace limits cannot be set.
- If not set, Workspace limits match the Organization’s limit.

## Response Headers

The API response includes headers that show the rate limit enforced, current usage, and when the limit will be reset.

### Response Headers

| Header                                      | Description                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| anthropic-ratelimit-requests-limit          | Maximum requests allowed within any rate limit period.      |
| anthropic-ratelimit-requests-remaining      | Requests remaining before being rate limited.               |
| anthropic-ratelimit-requests-reset          | Time when the request rate limit will reset.                |
| anthropic-ratelimit-tokens-limit            | Maximum tokens allowed within any rate limit period.        |
| anthropic-ratelimit-tokens-remaining        | Tokens remaining before being rate limited.                 |
| anthropic-ratelimit-tokens-reset            | Time when the token rate limit will reset.                  |
| anthropic-ratelimit-input-tokens-limit      | Maximum input tokens allowed within any rate limit period.  |
| anthropic-ratelimit-input-tokens-remaining  | Input tokens remaining before being rate limited.           |
| anthropic-ratelimit-input-tokens-reset      | Time when the input token rate limit will reset.            |
| anthropic-ratelimit-output-tokens-limit     | Maximum output tokens allowed within any rate limit period. |
| anthropic-ratelimit-output-tokens-remaining | Output tokens remaining before being rate limited.          |
| anthropic-ratelimit-output-tokens-reset     | Time when the output token rate limit will reset.           |
| retry-after                                 | Seconds until you can retry the request.                    |

## Legacy Rate Limits

Previously, rate limits were measured in requests per minute, tokens per minute, and tokens per day for each model class. Exceeding any of these limits results in a 429 error.

### Legacy Rate Limits per Model

| Model             | Maximum RPM | Maximum TPM | Maximum TPD |
| ----------------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Claude 3.5 Sonnet | 50          | 40,000      | 1,000,000   |
| Claude 3.5 Haiku  | 50          | 50,000      | 5,000,000   |

## Key Points

- The Message Batches API allows for batch processing of messages.
- It includes endpoints for creating, retrieving, and canceling message batches.
- Authentication is required via an API key and versioning is managed through headers.
- The processing status of message batches can be tracked through the API.
- Results are provided in a JSON Lines format and may not retain the original request order.

## Formatted Text

## Message Batches (Beta)

### Retrieve a Message Batch (beta)

This endpoint is idempotent and can be used to poll for Message Batch completion. To access the results of a Message Batch, make a request to the `results_url` field in the response.
**GET**

```
/v1/messages/batches/{message_batch_id}
```

While in beta, this endpoint requires passing the `anthropic-beta` header with value `message-batches-2024-09-24`.

#### Headers

- **anthropic-beta**: Optional header to specify the beta version(s) you want to use.
  - To use multiple betas, use a comma-separated list like `beta1,beta2` or specify the header multiple times for each beta.
- **anthropic-version**: Required. The version of the Anthropic API you want to use.
- **x-api-key**: Required. Your unique API key for authentication. This key is required in the header of all API requests to authenticate your account and access Anthropic's services. Get your API key through the Console. Each key is scoped to a Workspace.

#### Path Parameters

- **message_batch_id**: Required. ID of the Message Batch.

### Response

- **200 - application/json**

# Migrating from Text Completions to Messages

ID: Not available
Channel Name: Anthropic
Published At: Not available
Processing Style: technical

---

## Summary

This document provides guidance on migrating from the Text Completions API to the Messages API, highlighting key differences in input/output formats, role specifications, and response structures.

## Tags

API, Migration, Text Completions, Messages, Anthropic, Claude

## Key Points

- Transitioning from raw string inputs in Text Completions to structured message lists in Messages.
- Role specification changes from "Human" and "Assistant" to "user" and "assistant".
- Differences in how responses are structured and accessed between the two APIs.
- Introduction of system prompts through a dedicated parameter in Messages.
- Changes in model version specification and stop reasons for responses.

## Formatted Text

## Migrating from Text Completions to Messages

When migrating from Text Completions to Messages, consider the following changes.

### Inputs and Outputs

The largest change between Text Completions and the Messages API is the way in which you specify model inputs and receive outputs from the model.
With Text Completions, inputs are raw strings:

```python
prompt = "\n\nHuman: Hello there\n\nAssistant: Hi, I'm Claude. How can I help?\n\nHuman: Can you explain Glycolysis to me?\n\nAssistant:"
```

With Messages, you specify a list of input messages instead of a raw prompt:

```python
messages = [
  {"role": "user", "content": "Hello there."},
  {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hi, I'm Claude. How can I help?"},
  {"role": "user", "content": "Can you explain Glycolysis to me?"},
]
```

Each input message has a role and content.

### Role Names

The Text Completions API expects alternating `\n\nHuman:` and `\n\nAssistant:` turns, but the Messages API expects user and assistant roles. You may see documentation referring to either “human” or “user” turns. These refer to the same role, and will be “user” going forward.
With Text Completions, the model’s generated text is returned in the completion values of the response:

```python
>>> response = anthropic.completions.create(...)
>>> response.completion
" Hi, I'm Claude"
```

With Messages, the response is the content value, which is a list of content blocks:

```python
>>> response = anthropic.messages.create(...)
>>> response.content
[{"type": "text", "text": "Hi, I'm Claude"}]
```

### Putting Words in Claude’s Mouth

With Text Completions, you can pre-fill part of Claude’s response:

```python
prompt = "\n\nHuman: Hello\n\nAssistant: Hello, my name is"
```

With Messages, you can achieve the same result by making the last input message have the assistant role:

```python
messages = [
  {"role": "human", "content": "Hello"},
  {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello, my name is"},
]
```

When doing so, response content will continue from the last input message content:

```json
{
  "role": "assistant",
  "content": [{"type": "text", "text": " Claude. How can I assist you today?" }],
  ...
}
```

### System Prompt

With Text Completions, the system prompt is specified by adding text before the first `\n\nHuman:` turn:

```python
prompt = "Today is January 1, 2024.\n\nHuman: Hello, Claude\n\nAssistant:"
```

With Messages, you specify the system prompt with the system parameter:

```python
anthropic.Anthropic().messages.create(
    model="claude-3-opus-20240229",
    max_tokens=1024,
    system="Today is January 1, 2024.", # <-- system prompt
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude"}
    ]
)
```

### Model Names

The Messages API requires that you specify the full model version (e.g. claude-3-opus-20240229). We previously supported specifying only the major version number (e.g. claude-2), which resulted in automatic upgrades to minor versions. However, we no longer recommend this integration pattern, and Messages do not support it.

### Stop Reason

Text Completions always have a stop_reason of either:

- `"stop_sequence"`: The model either ended its turn naturally, or one of your custom stop sequences was generated.
- `"max_tokens"`: Either the model generated your specified max_tokens of content, or it reached its absolute maximum.
  Messages have a stop_reason of one of the following values:
- `"end_turn"`: The conversational turn ended naturally.
- `"stop_sequence"`: One of your specified custom stop sequences was generated.
- `"max_tokens"`: (unchanged)

### Specifying Max Tokens

- Text Completions: `max_tokens_to_sample` parameter. No validation, but capped values per-model.
- Messages: `max_tokens` parameter. If passing a value higher than the model supports, returns a validation error.

### Streaming Format

When using `"stream": true` with Text Completions, the response included any of completion, ping, and error server-sent-events. See Text Completions streaming for details.
Messages can contain multiple content blocks of varying types, and so its streaming format is somewhat more complex. See Messages streaming for details.

## Summary

This document provides an overview of the Message Batches feature in the Anthropic API, detailing how to retrieve results from a message batch and the required headers and parameters for making API requests.

## Tags

Anthropic API, Message Batches, API Reference, JSON, HTTP Requests

## Key Points

- The endpoint for retrieving message batch results streams results as a .jsonl file.
- Each line in the .jsonl file is a JSON object corresponding to a request in the message batch.
- The `anthropic-beta` header is required to specify the beta version.
- The `x-api-key` is mandatory for authentication in all API requests.
- The `message_batch_id` is required to identify the specific message batch.

## Formatted Text

## MESSAGE BATCHES (BETA)

### Retrieve Message Batch Results (beta)

Streams the results of a Message Batch as a `.jsonl` file.
Each line in the file is a JSON object containing the result of a single request in the Message Batch. Results are not guaranteed to be in the same order as requests. Use the `custom_id` field to match results to requests.
**GET**  
`/v1/messages/batches/{message_batch_id}/results`
While in beta, this endpoint requires passing the `anthropic-beta` header with value `message-batches-2024-09-24`. The path for retrieving Message Batch results should be pulled from the batch’s `results_url`. This path should not be assumed and may change.

### Headers

- **anthropic-beta**: `string[]`  
  Optional header to specify the beta version(s) you want to use. To use multiple betas, use a comma-separated list like `beta1,beta2` or specify the header multiple times for each beta.
- **anthropic-version**: `string`  
  Required. The version of the Anthropic API you want to use. Read more about versioning and our version history here.
- **x-api-key**: `string`  
  Required. Your unique API key for authentication. This key is required in the header of all API requests to authenticate your account and access Anthropic's services. Get your API key through the Console. Each key is scoped to a Workspace.

### Path Parameters

- **message_batch_id**: `string`  
  Required. ID of the Message Batch.

### Response

- **200** - `application/x-jsonl`  
  The response is of type file.

### Example cURL Request

```bash
curl https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages/batches/msgbatch_01HkcTjaV5uDC8jWR4ZsDV8d/results \

## Tags

API, Anthropic, Messages API, JSON, LLM, Machine Learning, Conversational AI

## Key Points

- The Messages API is stateless and requires the full conversational history for each request.
- Supports multiple programming languages including Shell, Python, and TypeScript for API interaction.
- Capable of processing both text and images in requests.
- Allows pre-filling responses to shape the assistant's output.
- Provides examples for basic requests, multiple conversational turns, and tool usage.

## Formatted Text

# Anthropic Messages API Documentation

## Basic Request and Response

```json
{
  "id": "msg_01XFDUDYJgAACzvnptvVoYEL",
  "type": "message",
  "role": "assistant",
  "content": [
    {
      "type": "text",
      "text": "Hello!"
    }
  ],
  "model": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "stop_reason": "end_turn",
  "stop_sequence": null,
  "usage": {
    "input_tokens": 12,
    "output_tokens": 6
  }
}
```

## Multiple Conversational Turns

The Messages API is stateless, which means that you always send the full conversational history to the API. You can use this pattern to build up a conversation over time. Earlier conversational turns don’t necessarily need to actually originate from Claude — you can use synthetic assistant messages.

### Shell Example

```shell
#!/bin/sh
curl https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages \
     --header "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
     --header "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
     --header "content-type: application/json" \
     --data \
'{
    "model": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
    "max_tokens": 1024,
    "messages": [
        {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude"},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello!"},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Can you describe LLMs to me?"}
    ]
}'
```

### Python Example

```python
import anthropic
message = anthropic.Anthropic().messages.create(
    model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
    max_tokens=1024,
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude"},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello!"},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Can you describe LLMs to me?"}
    ],
)
print(message)
```

### TypeScript Example

```typescript
import Anthropic from "@anthropic-ai/sdk";
const anthropic = new Anthropic();
await anthropic.messages.create({
  model: "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  max_tokens: 1024,
  messages: [
    { role: "user", content: "Hello, Claude" },
    { role: "assistant", content: "Hello!" },
    { role: "user", content: "Can you describe LLMs to me?" },
  ],
});
```

## Putting Words in Claude’s Mouth

You can pre-fill part of Claude’s response in the last position of the input messages list. This can be used to shape Claude’s response.

```json
{
  "id": "msg_01Q8Faay6S7QPTvEUUQARt7h",
  "type": "message",
  "role": "assistant",
  "content": [
    {
      "type": "text",
      "text": "C"
    }
  ],
  "model": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "stop_reason": "max_tokens",
  "stop_sequence": null,
  "usage": {
    "input_tokens": 42,
    "output_tokens": 1
  }
}
```

## Vision

Claude can read both text and images in requests. Currently, we support the base64 source type for images, and the image/jpeg, image/png, image/gif, and image/webp media types.

```json
{
  "id": "msg_01EcyWo6m4hyW8KHs2y2pei5",
  "type": "message",
  "role": "assistant",
  "content": [
    {
      "type": "text",
      "text": "This image shows an ant, specifically a close-up view of an ant. The ant is shown in detail, with its distinct head, antennae, and legs clearly visible. The image is focused on capturing the intricate details and features of the ant, likely taken with a macro lens to get an extreme close-up perspective."
    }
  ],
  "model": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "stop_reason": "end_turn",
  "stop_sequence": null,
  "usage": {
    "input_tokens": 1551,
    "output_tokens": 71
  }
}
```

# Anthropic Message Batches API Documentation

## Creating a Message Batch

### Example usage for the Message Batches API

The Message Batches API supports the same set of features as the Messages API. While this page focuses on how to use the Message Batches API, see Messages API examples for examples of the Messages API featureset.

#### Python Example

```python
import anthropic
from anthropic.types.beta.message_create_params import MessageCreateParamsNonStreaming
from anthropic.types.beta.messages.batch_create_params import Request
client = anthropic.Anthropic()
message_batch = client.beta.messages.batches.create(
    requests=[
        Request(
            custom_id="my-first-request",
            params=MessageCreateParamsNonStreaming(
                model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
                max_tokens=1024,
                messages=[{
                    "role": "user",
                    "content": "Hello, world",
                }]
            )
        ),
        Request(
            custom_id="my-second-request",
            params=MessageCreateParamsNonStreaming(
                model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
                max_tokens=1024,
                messages=[{
                    "role": "user",
                    "content": "Hi again, friend",
                }]
            )
        )
    ]
)
print(message_batch)
```

#### JSON Response Example

```json
{
  "id": "msgbatch_013Zva2CMHLNnXjNJJKqJ2EF",
  "type": "message_batch",
  "processing_status": "in_progress",
  "request_counts": {
    "processing": 2,
    "succeeded": 0,
    "errored": 0,
    "canceled": 0,
    "expired": 0
  },
  "ended_at": null,
  "created_at": "2024-09-24T18:37:24.100435Z",
  "expires_at": "2024-09-25T18:37:24.100435Z",
  "cancel_initiated_at": null,
  "results_url": null
}
```

## Polling for Message Batch completion

To poll a Message Batch, you’ll need its id, which is provided in the response when creating a request or by listing batches. Example id: `msgbatch_013Zva2CMHLNnXjNJJKqJ2EF`.

### Python Example

```python
import anthropic
import time
client = anthropic.Anthropic()
message_batch = None
while True:
    message_batch = client.beta.messages.batches.retrieve(
        MESSAGE_BATCH_ID
    )
    if message_batch.processing_status == "ended":
        break
    print(f"Batch {MESSAGE_BATCH_ID} is still processing...")
    time.sleep(60)
print(message_batch)
```

## Listing all Message Batches in a Workspace

### Python Example

```python
import anthropic
client = anthropic.Anthropic()
# Automatically fetches more pages as needed.
for message_batch in client.beta.messages.batches.list(
    limit=20
):
    print(message_batch)
```

## Retrieving Message Batch Results

Once your Message Batch status is ended, you will be able to view the `results_url` of the batch and retrieve results in the form of a .jsonl file.

### Python Example

```python
import anthropic
client = anthropic.Anthropic()
# Stream results file in memory-efficient chunks, processing one at a time
for result in client.beta.messages.batches.results(
    MESSAGE_BATCH_ID,
):
    print(result)
```

## Canceling a Message Batch

Immediately after cancellation, a batch’s `processing_status` will be canceling. You can use the same polling for batch completion technique to poll for when cancellation is finalized as canceled batches also end up ended and may contain results.

### Python Example

```python
import anthropic
client = anthropic.Anthropic()
message_batch = client.beta.messages.batches.cancel(
    MESSAGE_BATCH_ID,
)
print(message_batch)
```

#### JSON Response Example

```json
{
  "id": "msgbatch_013Zva2CMHLNnXjNJJKqJ2EF",
  "type": "message_batch",
  "processing_status": "canceling",
  "request_counts": {
    "processing": 2,
    "succeeded": 0,
    "errored": 0,
    "canceled": 0,
    "expired": 0
  },
  "ended_at": null,
  "created_at": "2024-09-24T18:37:24.100435Z",
  "expires_at": "2024-09-25T18:37:24.100435Z",
  "cancel_initiated_at": "2024-09-24T18:39:03.114875Z",
  "results_url": null
}

# Anthropic API Documentation - Text Completions (Legacy)

ID: Not available
Channel Name: Anthropic
Published At: Not available

## Summary

This document provides an overview of the legacy Text Completions API from Anthropic, including guidelines for prompt formatting, validation rules, and examples of both erroneous and acceptable prompts.

## Tags

API, Text Completions, Prompt Validation, Legacy API, Anthropic, Claude

## Key Points

- The Text Completions API is a legacy service; migration to the Messages API is recommended.
- Basic prompt sanitization and validation are performed by the API.
- Prompts must follow specific formatting rules to avoid errors.
- Examples of common errors and acceptable prompts are provided.

## Formatted Text

# Text Completions (Legacy)

The Text Completions API is a legacy API. Future models and features will require use of the Messages API, and we recommend migrating as soon as possible.
The Anthropic API performs basic prompt sanitization and validation to help ensure that your prompts are well-formatted for Claude.
When creating Text Completions, if your prompt is not in the specified format, the API will first attempt to lightly sanitize it (for example, by removing trailing spaces). This exact behavior is subject to change, and we strongly recommend that you format your prompts with the recommended alternating `\n\nHuman:` and `\n\nAssistant:` turns.

## Validation Rules

The API will validate your prompt under the following conditions:

- The first conversational turn in the prompt must be a `\n\nHuman:` turn.
- The last conversational turn in the prompt must be a `\n\nAssistant:` turn.
- The prompt must be less than 100,000 - 1 tokens in length.

## Examples

### Prompts that will result in API errors:

```python
# Missing "\n\nHuman:" and "\n\nAssistant:" turns
prompt = "Hello, world"
# Missing "\n\nHuman:" turn
prompt = "Hello, world\n\nAssistant:"
# Missing "\n\nAssistant:" turn
prompt = "\n\nHuman: Hello, Claude"
# "\n\nHuman:" turn is not first
prompt = "\n\nAssistant: Hello, world\n\nHuman: Hello, Claude\n\nAssistant:"
# "\n\nAssistant:" turn is not last
prompt = "\n\nHuman: Hello, Claude\n\nAssistant: Hello, world\n\nHuman: How many toes do dogs have?"
# "\n\nAssistant:" only has one "\n"
prompt = "\n\nHuman: Hello, Claude \nAssistant:"
```

### Currently accepted and automatically sanitized prompts:

```python
# No leading "\n\n" for "\n\nHuman:"
prompt = "Human: Hello, Claude\n\nAssistant:"
# Trailing space after "\n\nAssistant:"
prompt = "\n\nHuman: Hello, Claude:\n\nAssistant: "
```

## Summary

This document provides an overview of the Anthropic API, detailing how to access it, authenticate requests, specify content types, and includes examples for various programming languages.

## Tags

API, Authentication, JSON, Client SDKs, Programming Examples

## Key Points

- The Anthropic API is accessible via a web Console and requires API keys for authentication.
- All requests must include an `x-api-key` header with the user's API key.
- The API accepts and returns data in JSON format.
- Examples are provided for using the API with curl, Python, TypeScript, and Shell.

## Formatted Text

# Anthropic API Documentation

## Accessing the API

The API is made available via our web Console. You can use the Workbench to try out the API in the browser and then generate API keys in Account Settings. Use workspaces to segment your API keys and control spend by use case.

## Authentication

All requests to the Anthropic API must include an `x-api-key` header with your API key. If you are using the Client SDKs, you will set the API when constructing a client, and then the SDK will send the header on your behalf with every request. If integrating directly with the API, you’ll need to send this header yourself.

## Content Types

The Anthropic API always accepts JSON in request bodies and returns JSON in response bodies. You will need to send the `content-type: application/json` header in requests. If you are using the Client SDKs, this will be taken care of automatically.

## Examples

### curl

```bash
curl https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages \
     --header "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
     --header "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
     --header "content-type: application/json" \
     --data \
'{
    "model": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
    "max_tokens": 1024,
    "messages": [
        {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, world"}
    ]
}'
```

### Python

```python
import requests
url = "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages"
headers = {
    "x-api-key": "YOUR_API_KEY",
    "anthropic-version": "2023-06-01",
    "content-type": "application/json"
}
data = {
    "model": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
    "max_tokens": 1024,
    "messages": [
        {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, world"}
    ]
}
response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)
print(response.json())
```

### TypeScript

```typescript
import axios from "axios";
const url = "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages";
const headers = {
  "x-api-key": "YOUR_API_KEY",
  "anthropic-version": "2023-06-01",
  "content-type": "application/json",
};
const data = {
  model: "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",

};
axios
  .post(url, data, { headers })
  .then((response) => console.log(response.data))
  .catch((error) => console.error(error));
```

### Shell

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages \
     -H "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
     -H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \

# Anthropic API Error Handling

ID: Not available
Channel Name: Anthropic
Published At: Not available
Processing Style: technical

---

## Summary

This document outlines the error handling mechanisms for the Anthropic API, detailing the HTTP error codes, error response formats, and the importance of the request ID for support inquiries.

## Tags

API, Error Handling, HTTP Status Codes, JSON

## Key Points

- The API uses standard HTTP error codes to indicate issues with requests.
- Common error codes include 400 for invalid requests, 401 for authentication issues, and 429 for rate limits.
- Errors are returned in a JSON format, providing a type and message for clarity.
- Each API response includes a unique request ID for tracking and support purposes.

## Formatted Text

### HTTP Errors

Our API follows a predictable HTTP error code format:

- **400 - invalid_request_error**: There was an issue with the format or content of your request. We may also use this error type for other 4XX status codes not listed below.
- **401 - authentication_error**: There’s an issue with your API key.
- **403 - permission_error**: Your API key does not have permission to use the specified resource.
- **404 - not_found_error**: The requested resource was not found.
- **413 - request_too_large**: Request exceeds the maximum allowed number of bytes.
- **429 - rate_limit_error**: Your account has hit a rate limit.
- **500 - api_error**: An unexpected error has occurred internal to Anthropic’s systems.
- **529 - overloaded_error**: Anthropic’s API is temporarily overloaded.
  When receiving a streaming response via SSE, it’s possible that an error can occur after returning a 200 response, in which case error handling wouldn’t follow these standard mechanisms.

### Error Shapes

Errors are always returned as JSON, with a top-level error object that always includes a type and message value. For example:

```json
{
  "type": "error",
  "error": {
    "type": "not_found_error",
    "message": "The requested resource could not be found."
  }
}
```

In accordance with our versioning policy, we may expand the values within these objects, and it is possible that the type values will grow over time.

### Request ID

Every API response includes a unique request-id header. This header contains a value such as `req_018EeWyXxfu5pfWkrYcMdjWG`. When contacting support about a specific request, please include this ID to help us quickly resolve your issue.

ID: Not available
Channel Name: Anthropic
Published At: Not available
Processing Style: technical

---

## Summary

This document provides detailed information on the Message Batches feature of the Anthropic API, including how to create, retrieve, and cancel message batches. It outlines the required headers, path parameters, and the structure of the response for the cancellation of message batches.

## Tags

Anthropic API, Message Batches, API Reference, HTTP Requests, JSON, Beta Features

## Key Points

- Message Batches can be canceled before processing ends.
- Cancellation enters a "canceling" state where non-interruptible requests may still complete.
- Required headers include `anthropic-beta`, `anthropic-version`, and `x-api-key`.
- The response structure includes various attributes such as `processing_status`, `request_counts`, and timestamps for different events.

## Formatted Text

## MESSAGE BATCHES (BETA)

### Cancel a Message Batch (beta)

Batches may be canceled any time before processing ends. Once cancellation is initiated, the batch enters a canceling state, at which time the system may complete any in-progress, non-interruptible requests before finalizing cancellation.
The number of canceled requests is specified in `request_counts`. To determine which requests were canceled, check the individual results within the batch. Note that cancellation may not result in any canceled requests if they were non-interruptible.
**Endpoint:**

```
POST /v1/messages/batches/{message_batch_id}/cancel
```

While in beta, this endpoint requires passing the `anthropic-beta` header with value `message-batches-2024-09-24`.

### Headers

- `anthropic-beta`: string[] (Optional header to specify the beta version(s) you want to use.)
- `anthropic-version`: string (required, The version of the Anthropic API you want to use.)
- `x-api-key`: string (required, Your unique API key for authentication.)

### Path Parameters

- `message_batch_id`: string (required, ID of the Message Batch.)

### Response

- **200 - application/json**
  - `id`: string (required, Unique object identifier.)
  - `type`: enum<string> (default: message_batch, required, Object type.)
  - `processing_status`: enum<string> (required, Processing status of the Message Batch.)
  - `request_counts`: object (required, Tallies requests within the Message Batch, categorized by their status.)
    - `ended_at`: string | null (required, RFC 3339 datetime string representing the time at which processing for the Message Batch ended.)
    - `created_at`: string (required, RFC 3339 datetime string representing the time at which the Message Batch was created.)
    - `expires_at`: string (required, RFC 3339 datetime string representing the time at which the Message Batch will expire.)
    - `archived_at`: string | null (required, RFC 3339 datetime string representing the time at which the Message Batch was archived.)
    - `cancel_initiated_at`: string | null (required, RFC 3339 datetime string representing the time at which cancellation was initiated.)
    - `results_url`: string | null (required, URL to a .jsonl file containing the results of the Message Batch requests.)

### Example cURL Command

```bash
curl --request POST https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages/batches/msgbatch_01HkcTjaV5uDC8jWR4ZsDV8d/cancel \

## Accessing Claude Models on Amazon Bedrock

Anthropic’s Claude models are now generally available through Amazon Bedrock. Calling Claude through Bedrock slightly differs from how you would call Claude when using Anthropic’s client SDKs. This guide will walk you through the process of completing an API call to Claude on Bedrock in either Python or TypeScript.

### Prerequisites

Note that this guide assumes you have already signed up for an AWS account and configured programmatic access.

### Install and Configure the AWS CLI

1. Install a version of the AWS CLI at or newer than version 2.13.23.
2. Configure your AWS credentials using the `aws configure` command (see Configure the AWS CLI) or find your credentials by navigating to “Command line or programmatic access” within your AWS dashboard and following the directions in the popup modal.
3. Verify that your credentials are working:
   ```shell
   aws sts get-caller-identity
   ```

### Install an SDK for Accessing Bedrock

Anthropic’s client SDKs support Bedrock. You can also use an AWS SDK like boto3 directly.

#### For Python

```bash
pip install -U "anthropic[bedrock]"
```

### Accessing Bedrock

#### Subscribe to Anthropic Models

Go to the AWS Console > Bedrock > Model Access and request access to Anthropic models. Note that Anthropic model availability varies by region. See AWS documentation for the latest information.

### API Model Names

| Model             | Bedrock API Model Name                    |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Claude 3 Haiku    | anthropic.claude-3-haiku-20240307-v1:0    |
| Claude 3 Sonnet   | anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0   |
| Claude 3 Opus     | anthropic.claude-3-opus-20240229-v1:0     |
| Claude 3.5 Haiku  | anthropic.claude-3-5-haiku-20241022-v1:0  |
| Claude 3.5 Sonnet | anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0 |

### List Available Models

The following examples show how to print a list of all the Claude models available through Bedrock:

#### AWS CLI

```shell
aws bedrock list-foundation-models --region=us-west-2 --by-provider anthropic --query "modelSummaries[*].modelId"
```

### Making Requests

The following examples show how to generate text from Claude 3 Sonnet on Bedrock:

#### Python

```python
from anthropic import AnthropicBedrock
client = AnthropicBedrock(
    aws_access_key="<access key>",
    aws_secret_key="<secret key>",
    aws_session_token="<session_token>",
    aws_region="us-west-2",
)
message = client.messages.create(
    model="anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0",
    max_tokens=256,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello, world"}]

## Summary

This document provides an overview of accessing Anthropic's Claude models through Vertex AI, detailing the differences in API usage, model availability, and how to make requests using various programming languages.

## Tags

Anthropic, Claude, Vertex AI, API, SDK, Python, TypeScript, GCP

## Key Points

- Claude models are available via Vertex AI with specific API usage differences.
- Model specification is done through the Google Cloud endpoint URL in Vertex AI.
- The `anthropic_version` must be set in the request body for Vertex AI.
- SDK installation is required for accessing Vertex AI.
- Authentication with GCP is necessary before making requests.

## Formatted Text

# Anthropic’s Claude Models on Vertex AI

Anthropic’s Claude models are now generally available through Vertex AI.

## Key Differences in API Usage

The Vertex API for accessing Claude is nearly identical to the Messages API with two key differences:

- In Vertex, the model is not passed in the request body. Instead, it is specified in the Google Cloud endpoint URL.
- In Vertex, `anthropic_version` is passed in the request body (rather than as a header) and must be set to the value `vertex-2023-10-16`.
  Vertex is also supported by Anthropic’s official client SDKs. This guide will walk you through the process of making a request to Claude on Vertex AI in either Python or TypeScript.
  Note that this guide assumes you have already set up a GCP project that can use Vertex AI. See using the Claude 3 models from Anthropic for more information on the setup required, as well as a full walkthrough.

## Install an SDK for Accessing Vertex AI

First, install Anthropic’s client SDK for your language of choice.

### Python

```bash
pip install -U google-cloud-aiplatform "anthropic[vertex]"
```

### TypeScript

_Installation instructions for TypeScript not provided in the content._

## Accessing Vertex AI

### Model Availability

Note that Anthropic model availability varies by region. Search for “Claude” in the Vertex AI Model Garden or go to Use Claude 3 for the latest information.

### API Model Names

| Model                          | Vertex AI API Model Name      |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| Claude 3 Haiku                 | claude-3-haiku@20240307       |
| Claude 3 Sonnet                | claude-3-sonnet@20240229      |
| Claude 3 Opus (Public Preview) | claude-3-opus@20240229        |
| Claude 3.5 Haiku               | claude-3-5-haiku@20241022     |
| Claude 3.5 Sonnet              | claude-3-5-sonnet-v2@20241022 |

## Making Requests

Before running requests, you may need to run `gcloud auth application-default login` to authenticate with GCP.
The following example shows how to generate text from Claude 3 Haiku on Vertex AI:

### Python Example

```python
from anthropic import AnthropicVertex
project_id = "MY_PROJECT_ID"
# Where the model is running. e.g. us-central1 or europe-west4 for haiku
region = "MY_REGION"
client = AnthropicVertex(project_id=project_id, region=region)
message = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-3-haiku@20240307",
    max_tokens=100,
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Hey Claude!",
        }
    ],
)
print(message)
```

See our client SDKs and the official Vertex AI docs for more details.
